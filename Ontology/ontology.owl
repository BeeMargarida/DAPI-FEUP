But as the boy grew older he began to want more from the tree, and the tree gave and gave and gave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a tender story, touched with sadness, aglow with consolation. Shel Silverstein has created a moving parable for readers of all ages that offers an affecting interpretation of the gift of giving and a serene acceptance of another&apos;s capacity to love in return.</obo:OWLDataProperty_00000000000000000026>

The tale of Dorian Gray’s moral disintegration caused a scandal when it ﬁrst appeared in 1890, but though Wilde was attacked for the novel’s corrupting inﬂuence, he responded that there is, in fact, “a terrible moral in &lt;i&gt;Dorian Gray&lt;/i&gt;.” Just a few years later, the book and the aesthetic/moral dilemma it presented became issues in the trials occasioned by Wilde’s homosexual liaisons, which resulted in his imprisonment. Of Dorian Gray’s relationship to autobiography, Wilde noted in a letter, “Basil Hallward is what I think I am: Lord Henry what the world thinks me: Dorian what I would like to be—in other ages, perhaps.”</obo:OWLDataProperty_00000000000000000026>

So when offered a chance to explore the world past the limits she&apos;s known, Tris is ready. Perhaps beyond the fence, she and Tobias will find a simple new life together, free from complicated lies, tangled loyalties, and painful memories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Tris&apos;s new reality is even more alarming than the one she left behind. Old discoveries are quickly rendered meaningliess. Explosive new truths change the hearts of those she loves. And once again, Tris must battle to comprehend to complexities of human nature - and of herself - while facing impossible choices about courage, allegiance, sacrifice, and love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told from a riveting dual perspective, ALLEGIANT, by #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; best-selling author Veronica Roth, brings the DIVERGENT series to a powerful conclusion while revealing the secrets of the dystopian world that has captivated millions of readers in DIVERGENT and INSURGENT.</obo:OWLDataProperty_00000000000000000026>

The story explores the complex, multi-layered interactions of politics, religion, ecology, technology, and human emotion as the forces of the empire confront each other for control of Arrakis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Published in 1965, it won the Hugo Award in 1966 and the inaugural Nebula Award for Best Novel. Dune is frequently cited as the world&apos;s best-selling sf novel.</obo:OWLDataProperty_00000000000000000026>

In his inimitable, humorous verse and pictures, he addresses the Great Balancing Act (life itself, and the ups and downs it presents) while encouraging us to find the success that lies within us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;And will you succeed?&lt;br /&gt;Yes! You will indeed!&lt;br /&gt;(98 and ¾ percent guaranteed.)&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A modern classic, &lt;i&gt;Oh, the Places You&apos;ll Go!&lt;/i&gt; was first published one year before Dr. Seuss&apos;s death at the age of eighty-seven. In a mere fifty-six pages, Dr, Seuss managed to impart a lifetime of wisdom. It is the perfect send-off for children starting out in the maze of life, be they nursery school grads or newly-minted PhD&apos;s. Everyone will find it inspired good fun.</obo:OWLDataProperty_00000000000000000026>

It mainly follows the life of Captain John Yossarian, a U.S. Army Air Forces B-25 bombardier. Most of the events in the book occur while the fictional 256th Squadron is based on the island of Pianosa, in the Mediterranean Sea, west of Italy. The novel looks into the experiences of Yossarian and the other airmen in the camp, who attempt to maintain their sanity while fulfilling their service requirements so that they may return home.</obo:OWLDataProperty_00000000000000000026>

The unworldly, innocent Ana is startled to realize she wants this man and, despite his enigmatic reserve, finds she is desperate to get close to him. Unable to resist Ana’s quiet beauty, wit, and independent spirit, Grey admits he wants her, too—but on his own terms.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Shocked yet thrilled by Grey’s singular erotic tastes, Ana hesitates. For all the trappings of success—his multinational businesses, his vast wealth, his loving family—Grey is a man tormented by demons and consumed by the need to control. When the couple embarks on a daring, passionately physical affair, Ana discovers Christian Grey’s secrets and explores her own dark desires.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Erotic, amusing, and deeply moving, the Fifty Shades Trilogy is a tale that will obsess you, possess you, and stay with you forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;This book is intended for mature audiences.&lt;/b&gt;</obo:OWLDataProperty_00000000000000000026>

Anne knows she&apos;s not what they expected—a skinny girl with fiery red hair and a temper to match. If only she can convince them to let her stay, she&apos;ll try very hard not to keep rushing headlong into scrapes and blurting out the first thing that comes to her mind. Anne is not like anyone else, the Cuthberts agree; she is special—a girl with an enormous imagination. This orphan girl dreams of the day when she can call herself Anne of Green Gables.</obo:OWLDataProperty_00000000000000000026>

           HEY, KIDS AND SHEL SILVERSTEIN FANS! COME OVER HERE AND READ THIS!Okay, this some motherfuckin&apos; fucked-up shit right here. The Giving Tree is the straight-up wack story of how this selfish little ass-faced prick kicks it with this full-on saintly tree. Ever&apos;thin&apos; fine for a while, y&apos;all, with the lil&apos; prick all gettin&apos; up in there an&apos; sayin&apos; to the tree, &quot;Yeah, you know you mah bitch,&quot; but then all of a sudden, this jumped-up prick go through puberty, get his chia on or some such shit, and so he&apos;s off screwin&apos; the skank-ass bitches on the block all damn day and can&apos;t spare one motherfuckin&apos; minute for this poor old tree who waitin&apos; for him and lookin&apos; all motherfuckin&apos; sad an&apos; droopy an&apos; shit. So this little punk-ass bitch come up on the tree -- this is a motherfuckin&apos; tree, hear? -- and ask her [&apos;cuz she a sexy-ass lady-tree] fo&apos; some g&apos;s. Well, the tree is all, like, &quot;I ain&apos;t got no cash, bitch. What part o&apos; me say ATM on it? Mmm-hmmm. I thought so...&quot; And she shoulda held up there, but -- no -- this tree gets all fuckin&apos; benevolent and be, like, &quot;Well, I got mad apples you can go hustle on the streets.&quot; So this ass-faced prick just, like, boosts all these goddamn apples an&apos; leaves this tree with, like, its weave all out an&apos; shit. So next, after workin&apos; the streets wit his crew, little bitch boy come back, lookin&apos; all older an&apos; jacked-up, and ask the motherfuckin&apos; tree for a goddamn crib. So the tree like, &quot;Hol&apos; up. Do you even fuckin&apos; see Coldwell Banker all up an&apos; down in here? I think not.&quot; But then, being all kindly an&apos; shit, the tree is, like, &quot;But I got mad branches...&quot; And what? She motherfuckin&apos; takes it up back again fo&apos; this fool. Later, another goddamn time, punk-ass bitch come back, lookin&apos; all old an&apos; saggy and wack now, and he like, &quot;Bitch, what you got fo&apos; me now?&quot; &quot;Awww, hell naw,&quot; tree says, but then she start gettin&apos; all soft an&apos; shit again an&apos; say, &quot;Why don&apos; you cut down my trunk or some such shit and go &apos;head and whittle a pimped-out yacht, full-on Hamptons-style?&quot; He, like, &quot;Yeah, I thought so, bitch.&quot; And then -- guess the fuck what? -- little shriveled-up, played-out mack come on back wit his ass all hemorrhoided-up an&apos; shit. He look straight-up nasty and old. Tree is, like, &quot;I know you ain&apos;t come t&apos;ask me. All&apos;s I got is a motherfuckin&apos; stump, you ass-faced motherfucker. How you gon&apos; come back at me like that?&quot; This punk-ass bitch is all drooling and jacked-up and just wanna sit the hell down. What do the motherfuckin&apos; tree do? She say, &quot;Hell no! You motherfuckin&apos; fucked-up fucker, get yo&apos; motherfuckin&apos; ass face out o&apos; here fo&apos; I cut you up good: give you some stank-ass mad tree fungus, motherfucker!&quot; The motherfuckin&apos; end, motherfuckers.  Okay, so that&apos;s not really the way The Giving Tree ends, but maybe it&apos;s the way it should. Some time ago, my ex-girlfriend and, afterward, long-time co-dependent friend gave me The Giving Tree as part of my birthday gift. I loved it, but I hated it, too, because I felt so bad for the tree who is endlessly shat upon by this worthless &quot;Boy&quot;--as he is always known, regardless of age; I longed to console the tree and, maybe a little, to condemn this book as yet another emotionally-scarring &quot;children&apos;s&quot; entertainment in the manner of Old Yeller. Don&apos;t give me any shit about learning valuable lessons. The only lesson I learned was that human beings are nothing but steaming piles of corn-freckled feces, and that I wanted to found a not-for-profit shelter for unloved trees and rabid dogs and any other nonhuman thing, living or not, which was either unwanted or despised.  Having said all this -- and although I don&apos;t approve of the treatment of the giving tree -- this book is very moving and very delicate. The delicacy is somewhat counteracted when the reader turns over the book and sees the author photograph of a thoroughly evil-looking Shel Silverstein. He looks like the sort of person who would burn down whole forests of rare giving trees just for kicks. Picture Othello just before he strangles Desdemona.  If you -- and, yes, I&apos;m talking to you personally -- are not moved by the plight of the tree after reading this book, then perhaps it&apos;s time to go an&apos; check yo&apos;self: are you the givin&apos; tree or are you the motherfuckin&apos; takin&apos; tree? Or are you the sneak-out-in-the-middle-of-the-night-an&apos;-steal-all-my-shit tree?
         
        
      This review, twice deleted by Goodreads and twice deleted by me, has been reinstated -- to the delight of some and, no doubt, the profound dismay of many more -- due to the preservationist instincts of Kim D., who knows my volatility and capriciousness all too well.If you find this review obnoxious, offensive, tiresome, stupid, and/or a symptom or cause of the decline of Western Civilization, then I invite you to point your blame-designating fingers her way. Her house is located somewhere in the northeastern United States, for those desirous of assembling a torch-wielding mob to pay her a visit and to learn her up real good &apos;bout moral&apos;ty and good taste and innernit etiquette.Also, if you hate this review, you are stupid and probably a retard, but I have nothing against stupidity or retardation because I&apos;m not a hurtful bigot like you.
    
  
        
      ...this is like going up to the attic, flicking away a dead mouse, and finding that thing that reminds you of hours in the family van with all the &quot;I&apos;m not touching you, moooooom!&quot; and stabbing for the last piece of chicken. Thanks for the memories.
    
  
        
      Wasn&apos;t this like three times as long before?? Or do I misremember?
    
  
        
      You giveth and you taketh away... snd giveth again.

      I&apos;m voting before it&apos;s back to the vaults for another generation.By the way, why was this fine review deleted? I still don&apos;t quite understand.
    
  
        
      this must be the 3rd or 4th? time I&apos;ve voted for this damn review.I can remember in my early days on GR, coming across this review and laughing out loud, what is this shit?and then reading it to my son, who I knew was old enough to be able to handle the obscenity-laden rapper-like ripping voice of it and we both agreed, this was some funny shit and this Kowalski-guy was one brilliant bastard.
    
  
        
      I also remember, in the early days, that it got flagged and removed and some of us got very vocal (the other Jessica was one, can&apos;t recall the rest) about censorship on our beloved goodreads.So...here it is again.am getting all nostalgic now;-)
    
  
        
      I love voting for this review.
    
  
        
      Ah, reveries of those bygone days when I read this review before, except I didn&apos;t, because I&apos;m not old as dirt like you Olden-Agers.Hilarious review, David. And yes, this book is beyond fucked up.
    
  
        
      ha yeah, I feel old as dirt...;-)
    
  
        
      The fact that this book is so immensely popular might speak, at least a little, to people not being as horrible as you&apos;d like to believe they are. I mean, don&apos;t get me wrong. I don&apos;t really care for the book and buying the book is just cutting down more of those damn trees anyway but I&apos;m just saying, come on David - - - give the world a hug every now and again.
    
  
        
      but the message of the book is a strange one...I remember when my son got it as a gift from an uncle...I read it to him, I loved the pictures...but what about this poor long-suffering tree? and this selfish boy?
    
  
        
      Yeah, sometimes the world will give you a little reacharound action while its, ya know, doin&apos; it bidness.
    
  
        
      Jessica - agreed!David - give your Uncle World a hug.
    
  
        
      It&apos;s back! Hello, old friend.
    
  
        
      David, Have you read The Taking Tree: A Selfish Parody?
    
  
        
      Yep! It&apos;s my fault! I take full on motherfuckin&apos; credit, dudes... Yay, David!

      Kim, you are my giving tree right now. This just made my month. Really. I&apos;ve copied and pasted this to myself; now there will be a second back-up. I&apos;m sure I&apos;m not the only one.
    
  
        
      I&apos;m telling. Mom! David&apos;s talking bad about The Giving Tree again!
    
  
        
      Yeah, where is Charissa these days? :)
    
  
        
      Like Lazarus, it returns. Praise GAWD!:)
    
  
        
      I wish there were a way to get this on Seth&apos;s update feed, but I doubt he has any friends left who would &quot;like&quot; this.
    
  
        
      I think that&apos;s the only reason I put this review back up. I knew that there was the possibility that that jackass Seth would stumble upon it and start frothing in curmudgeonly rage.
    
  
        
      I&apos;ve lost count how many times I&apos;ve voted for this review over the years. It is like that damn Christmas toffee... giddy as a school girl every time it is time for it to come back.
    
  
        
      I voted for this review cuz david asked me to vote for all of his reviews!
    
  
        
      The fro loves this too. &lt;3
    
  
        
      Okay, at first I was just appalled at the language! And then while reading I noticed how the language was definitely a must for your review of the book. It&apos;s been ages since I read the book, and I don&apos;t remember much of it anyway, but if I read it again now, I&apos;d probably write something similar to this (albeit a bit more cleaned up).Thanks for the honest review.P.S. After reading all the comments on this, I&apos;m surprised that I haven&apos;t seen this review before! Still, a part of me is glad that I had a chance to read this review before it probably gets deleted again.

      Says the woman who lists Danielle Steele as a favorite author. :) good reads is full of all kinds. That is what makes it great.
    
  
        
      ^^^^Michelle, high five.Yes, all kinds, and they usually come out to play on David&apos;s Giving Tree review thread. I wonder when the crazy chick with the rose avatar will figure out the review is back.

      This is q very heart warming story so if you don&apos;t like it and think that way about it then don&apos;t comment about it!!!! This is a place to comment good things about it!!!!!!
    
  
        
      I do agree though that the boy is VERY selfish but still give the book a break and the guy that wrote it looks very scary!!!!!
    
  
        
      No, this is not q place to only comment good things about books. This is q place to express your opinions (good or bad) on books.

           I recently read this book to my little boy. It&apos;s not the first time I&apos;ve read it. It&apos;s probably not even the tenth time. But it&apos;s the first time I&apos;ve read the book in a decade, and given the fact that my memory is like a cheese grater, I like to think I got a pretty fresh experience. The result is this: I honestly don&apos;t know how I feel about this book. Even if you haven&apos;t read the story, you probably know the gist of it. A tree loves a young boy and gives away pieces of itself to the boy to make the boy happy. On one hand, this story can be taken as an open, honest exhortation toward selfless Agape-style love. Love which asks nothing. Love which gives everything. On the other hand, this story can be read as a horrifying condemnation of dysfunctional unrequited co-dependance. After reading the book, I honestly don&apos;t know which it is. On one hand, taking this book at face value is probably a fool&apos;s game. Silverstein was a twisted sarcastic bastard. He wrote lyrics for Dr. Hook. (Most notably &quot;Freaking at the Freaker&apos;s Ball.&quot;) And back in my misspent youth, I discovered a poem of his in one of my Dad&apos;s Playboys. It was called &quot;The Great Pot Smoke-Off.&quot; My point is, dude was part of the counterculture. He was full of mocking and meta. And as such, it seems odd that he would write something that seems like an obvious endorsement of Christ-like selflessness... and then that was it.But on the other hand, when Silverstein was having fun with you, he usually didn&apos;t pussyfoot around. One of his earliest publications was &quot;Uncle Shelby&apos;s ABZ book.&quot; Which *looks* like a kid&apos;s book, but is clearly not: Here&apos;s a piece from the page on Potty Training: &quot;See the pottyThe potty is deepThe potty has water in the bottom. &quot;Maybe someone will fall into the potty and drown. &quot;Don&apos;t worry. As long as you keep wetting your pants, you will never drown in the potty.&quot;Not a lot of ambiguity here. His tongue is pretty clearly in his cheek. But when I read through The Giving Tree, I don&apos;t see the author winking at me from behind the scenes. The story *seems* to be straightforward. But here&apos;s the thing, even if the story *is* straightforward, I don&apos;t know how I feel about it. Is the boy selfish in the story? Absolutely. He&apos;s a little shit. Yet he doesn&apos;t get one bit of comeuppance. We kinda want him to, but that&apos;s not what happens. The boy doesn&apos;t seem to learn a lesson. And neither does the tree. That seems to imply there is no lesson to be learned here. Let&apos;s be clear. The tree is *happy* at the end of the book. There&apos;s no ambiguity about that. It&apos;s entirely possible that the tree has acted in its own best interest. It&apos;s entirely possible that the tree, if you&apos;ll forgive the expression, is acting according to the Lethani.Even after thinking it over for a couple days, still I don&apos;t know how I feel about it. That&apos;s a rarity for me. For that reason, I&apos;m giving this five stars. If you write a book that leaves me asking questions. If you write a book that people can have legitimate disagreements about. If you write a book that people can still wrangle over after fifty years… that&apos;s pretty clearly a five-star book.
         
        
      I had always taken it as a metaphor for the parent/child relationship: one-way giving and completely content with it.
    
  
        
      I&apos;ve always disliked this book. I find the boy takes advantage of the tree. The relationship is so one sided, it irks me. It feels like an abusive relationship.On the other hand, you are right, the book provokes thought, makes you wonder what the author was trying to accomplish.
    
  
        
      I have been a fan of this book since being a teenager. To me it conveys having true love in your life is a timeless gift. You don&apos;t keep a tally on whom gives more, just relish on the happiest you possess because it&apos;s real to you.
    
  
        
      I don&apos;t think the book is as simple as it being about selfless love of a parent towards a child, nor is it simply about an abusive or codependant relationship either. It&apos;s entirely possible he meant it to be seen both ways, depending on the readers perspective. Love it or hate it, it&apos;s a great book.
    
  
        
      I&apos;ve hated this book since the first time I read it, for the reasons you provide. I don&apos;t like what it has to say to kids, and I didn&apos;t read it to my children because I do not think it provides any example for them to follow and they are too young (at the age that book it directed to) to engage in line-drawing and gray areas. I&apos;d give it zero stars as reading for the non-abstract-thinking ages, though I&apos;d agree that for more developed brains, it can provide food for thought.Thanks for the validation!
    
  
        
      What this story needs is a Lorax. Poor tree. Perhaps the story is sort of an ironic lesson in Manifest Destiny. Earth gives. We humans take -- and take -- and take. We talked about this in class last week because it&apos;s a banned book. My Juniors gave it mixed reviews. Most thought the boy was a selfish jerk.
    
  
        
      My ten year old self interpreted it to be the successive journey of a man&apos;s life. The man&apos;s desires not satisfying him (he even leaves his wife), he settles for simple contentment, as older folk do. It&apos;s not so much a straightforward lesson as it is an exploration of the beats of a life.I&apos;ll tell you this much: when I first read it, I bawled my eyes out for the man and the selflessness of the tree. As an adult, I&apos;m unsure what to make of the tree..but think that&apos;s the point.Far too often children&apos;s literature settles on a one-sentence theme. Be good. Be selfless. Share. The Giving Tree&apos;s power is that it leaves you with feelings to explore. It&apos;s something children&apos;s literature seems woefully devoid of, which strikes me as unfair.
    
  
        
      I used to think of the book with deep ambivalence but my son loved it when he was little. We spent a great deal of time talking about it. The boy said that he would be happy, but was he *really?* The tree tried to *make* the boy happy. Did it work? Can you *make* someone be happy? Why not? When was the boy actually happy? Why? Read in this way, I lost all of my ambivalence. It was a fantastic opportunity to deeply examine and discuss behavioral motivations. Kudos to Shel for helping my kid think.
    
  
        
      Seeing as my brain tends to live in the land of the literal all too often (it also avoids theological comparisons) my interpretation deviates from other views. As fanciful as it may sound, I do believe this book planted in me a seed to love trees. I loved this book the first time I read it and I cry still when I read it now. Trees are givers, they give us the very air we breathe and more, and humans, well, we tear them down in mass and do not give them the real love they deserve. Be as it may a whimsical tree hugging perspective, I care not, it is what the giving tree gave me. :)
    
  
        
      I agree that the story is beautiful if you&apos;re a parent and have experienced the sense of pure, utter love for an infant. Any parent knows that, at least at the beginning, that is a one-sided relationship. However, since the majority of people having this story read to them are not parents, but rather children themselves, I think that gets a little lost. Most of us will probably interpret this story as an abusive DV relationship right up until we have kids. Only then can we go, &quot;Ohhhhh,&quot; and consider the story sweet.Until then, I&apos;m with the Sassy Gay Friend on Youtube in his review. &quot;A torso suit? That&apos;s &amp;(*(&amp;ed up!&quot; Very &quot;Silence of the Lambs.&quot;
    
  
        
      THANK YOU! This book has always given me the heeby-jeebies.
    
  
        
      Exactly! I never liked it, even as a kid. I felt like no one really accomplished anything in it. By the time the book ends, you realize that you will grow old and die. And really, what will you have done? Will you have mattered? Probably not much, but that&apos;s okay. Be like the tree and be happy. I thought that was a terribly depressing view of life, compared to all of the much more encouraging books you read in elementary school. I was always so sorry for that tree, so simple that it didn&apos;t even realize how depressing it was. It&apos;s a beautiful book. It truly is art. Art shouldn&apos;t teach, it should make you feel and make you wonder and thus make you discover so that you learn for yourself. It&apos;s great art, but I can&apos;t say I like it very much.
    
  
        
      As someone who lost his mother suddenly this year, I feel like I very nearly understand the book. I wish I could explain better, but there it is.
    
  
        
      So... I&apos;ve thought a lot about this book. I actually gave it to a boyfriend during a fairly abusive relationship. Let me tell you, the interpretation of this book as a tale of deep, troubling codependency was not lost on me, even then.However, I think it can also be seen as parental love, or the love of God, or how the lessons of our parents take us far away from them, and then bring us back to them. The inevitable passing of the generations.So I think his point might be both of these. As children of our parents or of a god, we are selfish in a way that is both quite dark and also, an inevitable part of growing up. I wonder if he drew the tree as an apple tree on purpose?
    
  
        
      I feel as though this book is expertly written to be whatever the reader brings to the table. Like all interactions in the world, each side of the interaction brings their own particulars to bear. The book is a mirror. You see what you need to see when you read it.
    
  
        
      I always thought of the book as being a clear mirror of a wrong behavior. When I read it as a child I was so impacted by the rudeness and clear disregard for the trees feelings that it made me want to act in the opposite. It gave me a reference on how to not act. It also gave a reference for me to realize when even though I did love someone there is a point where you can end up cutting yourself down and still feeling happy for it, but in the end you&apos;re still just a stump. It was a good way to realize that I was in fact enmeshed with enough emotional intelligence to realize that it takes two to cut down a tree. The person with the saw, and the tree that didn&apos;t move out of the way.
    
  
        
      Beautifully put James
    
  
        
      Kind of a bad analogy, Jacob, seeing as how trees can&apos;t move regardless.
    
  
        
      I think this book was written to be looked at in different ways, I think it was a story that was supposed to be undefinable. A story in which the readers would try and find something meaningful in something that doesn&apos;t mean anything, it just is.Like many things in life when humans try and define something, put a number on it and file it in just the right spot. Not everything has it&apos;s perfect place, some things just don&apos;t have an explanation or a raison d&apos;être.I think that&apos;s what the author was trying to accomplish here. And yes I believe the bastard is laughing at us all trying to define something and find a lesson in something that isn&apos;t and never will be those things.Maybe that&apos;s a lesson in and of itself.Or maybe it&apos;s 1:30am and I just need to go to sleep.
    
  
        
      I&apos;ve always thought of this book as perpetuating the repellent stereotype of women as eternally self-sacrificing. I think the idea of selfless love is taken to a horrific extreme, and I think it&apos;s a horrible thing to teach children. I don&apos;t recommend it to people who come to my bookstore, and when people ask for it by name, I feel compelled to recommend choices to them.
    
  
        
      I would be a terrible critic because I generally don&apos;t care about what hidden messages the creator might have left (intentionally or otherwise) lurking between the lines. Unless, of course, its beating me over the head with some moral judgment (or judgmental moral) that could have been conveyed more subtly.I like or dislike a thing based on how I take it, my personal interpretation. Its all about how I can relate to my own experience or feelings. I was one of those sad, lonely kids who felt like they were unloved. On one hand, I was willing to put myself out there with gestures of affection because I never wanted anyone I liked to doubt that they were cared for. On the other, I secretly wished that just one person could care enough to show me in small ways that I was special to them. The Giving Tree appealed to me on both sides of the coin; I was in love with the idea that someone might be so selflessly devoted to another person. Of course, as I child I was also infatuated with tales of happy families where warmth and affection could be exchanged without reservation. Maybe my interpretation was pure wish fulfillment, but it gave me something I needed. Analyze codependence, selfishness, and whatever else... I&apos;ll stick with the message of hope received by an outcast child.
    
  
        
      Chalk me up as another vote in favor of The Giving Tree being analogous to the relationship between a parent and child. Obviously, there are several other ways to read it, but that&apos;s the one that always resonated strongest with me. I had always been under the impression that Silverstein wrote it with the intention of trying to teach children to be less selfish, to not just take without giving in return.
    
  
        
      I listed The Giving Tree in a resent list of books that have affected my life. I tend to be &quot;nurturer&quot; read co-dependent door mat. I have exactly the same feeling Pat dose about the book. On the one had being a selfless giving person is implied to be its own reward. On the other hand giving and giving and giving only to have the &quot;gifts&quot; tossed back in ones face through out a life time gets really old. Horrifyingly enough I am now finding that its become an ingrained habit I can&apos;t seem to stop. I admired the selflessness of the giving tree in my youth. I resent the lesson well learned in my age.
    
  
        
      I&apos;m in much the same boat as you, Patrick. I loved the book to pieces when I was a kid, because I dug of the idea of a tree loving you so much that it&apos;s willing to give so much of itself away. But now, as I read it to my four-year-old daughter (turning five in just a few weeks), I can&apos;t help but think about what a selfish little dick the boy in the story is, judging his love for the tree by what the tree can give him. But as you say, at the end, when the tree is just an old stump, it is *happy*. The story still makes me well up, but those feelings are conflicted.
    
  
        
      I just thought it was about how humanity rapes nature. Nature gives us everything and we just use it all up without giving anything back (in general). I never read this as a metaphor for love.
    
  
        
      I hate this book so much I hid it from my kids so I wouldn&apos;t have to read it again. My great hope is that they have no recollection of it when they&apos;re older. I love Silverstein usually but hate this one. I don&apos;t see anything to love or be ambivalent about. The boy is a nasty piece of work, he&apos;s selfish to the end to the point of destroying someone else. The tree has no personal boundaries and allows all of herself given till she is gone. And the story ends as if that&apos;s a good thing. Giving love should not destroy you. Receiving love should not be about selfishness and destroying another person. Worst message possible to kids. Ok. Silverstein may have meant it as a metaphor for something other than love, but most people take it as being about how beautiful selfless love is. I don&apos;t want my kids to learn that message at all. I&apos;ve gotten angry every time I&apos;ve read it.
    
  
        
      I&apos;m a mother to two little boys. My older son is 14 and an absolute sweetheart. He is gentle and kind and loving and I used to LOVE to read this book to him. My younger son is 9 and a force of nature. He is strong and wild and loving and I discovered that I HATE reading this book to him. My older son seemed to have an innate sense of when to &quot;stop.&quot; When to stop calling, whining, begging and yes, TAKING.My little one has no idea that boundaries exist and though he will learn someday, if allowed he would drain the banks of a river dry just to get a drink. Do not mistake this for a moment in thinking that I have a &quot;good&quot; son and a &quot;bad&quot; son. I have two great sons, both have strengths and both have flaws. There are things in both their natures that will serve them well later in life. This book however, helped me realize that as a mother parenting, nurturing and GIVING to children such as these can be a changeable event. I was resentful for a little while. I missed my love affair with the book. I had adored it since childhood. However, learning that I have the right to say, &quot;No, these are MY apples, dammit!&quot; Led me down a path towards better parenthood. Hell, better selfhood!
    
  
        
      How about this: horrifying RECOMMENDATION of dysfunctional unrequited co-dependence. It should be titled The Taking Boy.
    
  
        
      Can&apos;t edit that comment - want to add that I love your review.
    
  
        
      The tree might be happy, but that book always made me sad.
    
  
        
      I second that. Haven&apos;t read this since I was in the third grade but the kids vampiric relationshp with the tree made me really sad.
    
  
        
      really, Freakin at the Freaker&apos;s Ball, Silverstein? What a great tidbit for my brain to file away today, thanks Mr. Rothfuss
    
  
        
      Thank you for enlightening me about Shel Silverstein. I had no idea about his background, other than he has a very grumpy-looking picture. I agree that the message of &quot;The Giving Tree&quot; can be taken from many angles. As a parent, I&apos;ve always seen the tree as a parent, constantly giving of itself to a child who has no idea about the sacrifices it&apos;s made. Like a parent, the child&apos;s happiness is its own, no matter what it takes, and in the end, we learn that nobody can make someone happy all the time because life has its ups and downs. I agree that this book deserves five stars. It&apos;s a classic full of truths about love and life.
    
  
        
      I always took it as a straight forward metaphor for the way humankind treats nature. Taking all leaving none. I suppose its a little unfinished as to the consequences of this act when you look at it this way, but as a kid I never felt the need to have it spelled out. The man was old, alone and all his big dreams were dust.

      Well, that was a pretty damn good review. So much so, that I will be bringing this up in Lit Crit today with my professor. She didn&apos;t really want us discussing any Silverstein ... mostly as a poet ... but I think that this could warrant a robust discussion. :)
    
  
        
      I still think his best work is The Missing Piece Mets The Big O!
    
  
        
      An excellent review. I have gone from viewing the book with distrust, another message to me to be self-sacrificing, to just irritated at its message (to me) to be happy by giving up everything. I am glad to hear of Silverstein&apos;s seamier side.
    
  
        
      I completely agree. I haven&apos;t read it to my son yet because 1) it kind of disturbs me, and 2) it&apos;s hard for me to not ugly cry when I read it.
    
  
        
      hi
    
  
        
      I hate this book! I want the child at the end to give something back, something even a small part of what the tree gave him. Pay it forward. It speaks of selflessness on the trees part. However, the boy takes and NEVER returns or IMO even realizes all the gifts the tree gave. He just takes and never gives it a second thought, he has a serious sense of entitlement. What a great gift the tree gave to have nothing come from it, and while I realize this is the point, it should teach a child that at some point they should be aware of what others give in love. As a child&apos;s book it reinforces their view that the world revolves around them. As a child grows into an adult they need to realize that those that give us that love, while they may never ask for anything in return, is really our duty to become like the tree and give that type of love in return.
    
  
        
      &quot;For that reason, I&apos;m giving this five stars. If you write a book that leaves me asking questions. If you write a book that people can have legitimate disagreements about. If you write a book that people can still wrangle over after fifty years… that&apos;s pretty clearly a five-star book. &quot;True :)
    
  
        
      I want this book
    
  
        
      I haven&apos;t read this ng book, but would it be fine to think that it&apos;s simply painting a picture of life, with a reality that sometimes it sucks and that&apos;s just the way it is? There is no punishment or realization for the boy because in life not all issues, conflicts have resolutions. You cannot expect all things to turn out fine, but you can hope it would. But it doesn&apos;t always happen. Thoughts?
    
  
        
      I haven&apos;t read it but the discripstion sounds like it is great book for little girls and boys who like strange but exciting books that are surprisingly interesting.

           I know that many people have a sentimental love for this book, and I respect that -- you can&apos;t rationalize emotional connection. And generally, I like this author. But with this book, since it inspired no real emotional response in me, I am left with only the rational perspective, which in me was this: This book troubles me deeply, because it enshrines self-destructive and self-pitying martyrdom as the paragon of love for others. And I think there is already far too much of this in our society. This book seems to say that if you really love someone else, you will damage yourself, cripple yourself, tear down your boundaries, destroy yourself for them. And further, it implies that those who are loved must by nature use and devour those who love them. An incredibly unhealthy model for love and relationships, especially for a child&apos;s book. I am a parent of two, and though many parents have offered up this book as representative of the true nature of parental love, I cannot agree. If I were to raise my children this way, I feel I would only be teaching them to take selfishly from those who love them, to use people up and always expect more -- and on the flip side, I would be teaching them that if they love someone then they have to give of themselves until it hurts, have to live without boundaries of any kind. Instead of raising my kids this way, I feel it&apos;s important to teach them to respect those who love them and care for them, to not take from others so much that it damages; I feel it&apos;s important to teach them that even in love we all must maintain our boundaries, our integrity. I feel it&apos;s important that my kids, and all kids really, understand that real, healthy love does not demand destruction or diminishment of anyone involved in it, that in fact real and healthy love ultimately heals and builds up those who participate in it. I suppose that this book may have been intended as an anti-lesson, an example of how NOT to behave -- but if so, then it was not made clear that this was the case, because most people who read this book seem to take it as an ideal example of love. Certainly it&apos;s possible to not take it so seriously; but when the underlying message and philosophy is so concentrated and heavy-handed, it&apos;s hard to avoid tasting it in every passage.It reminds me of that other beloved childhood book about love, where the young boy&apos;s mother is so obsessive about cuddling him and tucking him in at night that even as he gets older and older, she follows him around, sneaks into his college dorm, sneaks into his home as an adult, takes him from his bed with his wife still sleeping and reassures him (herself?) that he&apos;ll &quot;always be my baby&quot;. *shudder*Overall: Sweet, but to the point of being cloying, and a disturbing message. =/

Ah well.]You asked, &quot;Have you ever loved someone so much that you would give anything for that person&apos;s happiness even though it hurt you&quot;... this is an example of exactly why I think this book is terrible -- the widespread idea that how much damage you take is a measure of how much you love someone. So the answer I would give to your question is, no, I&apos;ve loved with a far greater love than that martyrish, petty love of self-mutilation. I have loved someone so much that I refused to mutilate myself for them, which is I think a far greater love than the ultimately self-indulgent love of the Martyr. I love my children so much that I would never even consider warping their minds with the idea that the more you let someone hurt you, the more you love them. I have seen the results of that kind of thinking on people, and it&apos;s an ugly, terrible thing. Whichever character is primary, it&apos;s still no good. If I had a cartoon parent-tree and it really loved me, then I would rather it refused to hurt itself &quot;for me&quot;, taught me the lesson of moderation, and then was able to be there with me as I became an adult. The tree in the book gave the child a bunch of material goods with only transient value, taught to boy to value goods over the welfare of someone who loved him, and then when the boy grew up it was dead and gone. As a teacher, FAILURE. As a companion, FAILURE. As an enabler? Success. Certainly heartache is a part of love. A part to be accepted, endured, weathered -- not SOUGHT after, for gods&apos;sakes! There is enough pain and loss in the world as it is, we don&apos;t need to go around creating it and calling it &quot;love&quot;. I agree that this seems to fit in with the orthodox perception of Jesus and his teachings, and indeed I agree that many Christians would say that Jesus would be proud of the lessons this book teaches. This is one reason I am not a Christian, at least not in the sense of the orthodoxy that would embrace this book. Thanks again for the comment!
    
  
        
      I disagree that there is &quot;far too much of this in our society&quot;. I know of too few examples. While the tree is clearly the heo and the boy the villian, I don&apos;t think Silversten was pushing us to emulate the behavior of either. I think he was trying to show that the giver of love was, in the end, happier than the selfish taker. Of course the moral isn&apos;t to love our children as the tree does or raise our children to be the boy, the boy is miserable. I think it was more simply that there is pleasure in giving.

Did you perhaps miss that, or are you saying that you think there should be more examples of self-destructive and self-pitying martyrdom being put forth to others as the paragon of love?
    
  
        
      I thought I was some sort of outcast for not loving this book. I have always hated it and bristle at the mention of it. I know many take it as an allegory for love, but I have seen it simply in the context of Man and Nature. With Nature giving and giving and Man taking.
    
  
        
      ...if you really love someone else, you will damage yourself, cripple yourself, tear down your boundaries, destroy yourself for them. And further, it implies that those who are loved must by nature use and devour those who love them. An incredibly unhealthy model for love and relationships, especially for a child&apos;s book. honestly, you&apos;re right. I&apos;ve heard of this sort of thing in almost every sappy book I read. 
    
  
        
      I don&apos;t think the intent was for the book to be a model of relationships, nor was it saying that those who are loved, by nature, use and devour those who love them. THAT boy did, and the book showed how unhappy THAT boy was. I think the message was to appreciate those that love you unconditionally and not take advantage of such a precious gift. Although, if interpreted a certain way, I can understand how the tree could be seen as sending an unhealthy message. Again though, I don&apos;t think the story was meant for children to read and emulate the characters, simply to appreciate the people that care about you. I think this is a matter of authorial intent vs. reader interpretation.
    
  
        
      Very interesting and thought provoking review. I had NO idea that the rest of the world viewed this story as the picture of ideal love. Even as a little girl I always thought the moral of the story was that if you choose a selfish path in life, not only do you harm those around you, but you end up old, alone, and unfulfilled. 
    
  
        
      I agree with most of what you said. If you keep giving away pieces of yourself in a relationship, eventually there isn&apos;t much left of the original person to love. Relationships are all give and take without compromising who you sincerely are within. When people break you into little pieces because they feel entitled to do so, what is left of you as a person? I will read this book with my 13 year old son very soon. He is at the age where girls are getting interesting to him. I want him to know the right way yo treat a woman is NOT this way.
    
  
        
      I&apos;ve always felt the same way about this book. I only added it myself so I could give it a one star review. That it displays an unhealthy relationship is one thing, but that so many people get sentimental and warm hearted over the twisted thing is baffling.
    
  
        
      hahaha Danielle, I&apos;ve been there before - adding to give a one star rating!
    
  
        
      I agree a lot, I&apos;ve always felt this way about this book, it&apos;s like all kinds of people were saying like &quot;oh it&apos;s so sad because that is what kids have to end up doing to their parents in order to become good adults!&quot; and I&apos;m like... yeah... maybe if they are really selfish assholes that&apos;s what they would do...
    
  
        
      The Story about Ping just pissed me off this past week. It&apos;s so well loved and it&apos;s about beating a little duck. Go figure.
    
  
        
      I totally agree with you. This book creeps me out.
    
  
        
      &quot;This book troubles me deeply, because it enshrines self-destructive and self-pitying martyrdom as the paragon of love for others.&quot; I find it interesting that the people who hate this book all seem to agree that it was intended as a model for how to love. They never take it as a warning of exactly what you describe in your review. It could be that Shel Silverstein agrees with you completely. Of course, a sign of great art is that it is open to interpretation and allows for the different experiences that the readers bring with them. I love the book because the tree was loving the boy the only way it knew how, even if he was completely wrong to do so. I don&apos;t take it as a morality tale.
    
  
        
      Actually, I hated it and I don&apos;t know what the hell it was intended for. Nor do I care to find out quite honestly. I&apos;m just letting you know that your statement is all encompassing but it&apos;s wrong. I have some friends who hated this and felt differently - is varying stages - than the commenters here. I guess you could say *most* and be correct. But definitely not *all*.
    
  
        
      I agree that this book can be a terrible example for relationships if you don&apos;t talk with your child about it. When I read this to my son (age 3) I ask lots of questions like: &quot;how do you think the tree felt&quot; and &quot;how does the boy feel&quot; and &quot;what could they have done differently to be better friends&quot; and &quot;what could the boy have done to earn money instead of ruining the tree?&quot; and &quot;what could you do if a friend tried to take your clothes, toys, shoes, and house? Would you like that? what might you say?&quot; Sometimes it&apos;s nice to have a book where you can ask your child deeper questions and make them figure out what is right and wrong rather than the fluffy crap that some people put in children&apos;s books these days. This is a book that I would use as a teaching tool with my son, more so than just a bedtime, feel good story.
    
  
        
      I think that you took the message the wrong way. We don&apos;t need to destroy ourselves for the ones we love. The tree gave herself to the boy because she loved him. Love is one of the most, if not THE most, powerful forces of the universe and the tree was being selfless. That&apos;s what love is all about.
    
  
        
      Well, yes, but I see that as part of the problem -- this ideal of love being put forward is that love, really big fundamental love, is selfless. That love means just constantly chopping off parts of yourself for your loved one to use up and take for granted. That love means not caring if your enabling and coddling and absence of self leads to your loved one becoming oblivious, narcissistic, and a user. I agree that love is one of the most (if not the most) powerful forces of the universe. I just don&apos;t equate love with lack of self.
    
  
        
      It&apos;s just a book. Little kids don&apos;t think of it that way. To them it&apos;s just cool that a tree was talking. At least for me it was. I knew trees didn&apos;t really do that I just thought it was really awesome that someone came up with that ...

This kind of subconscious conditioning slips in unnoticed, under the kids&apos; minimally-developed radar, not filtered or evaluated by the conscious mind. It&apos;s just set before them as a model of love, and they accept it and think it&apos;s cool.&quot;Just a book&quot;, though -- can&apos;t agree with that dismissive attitude. Books can and have changed the world.
    
  
        
      Melissa -- good lord, yes, if you don&apos;t talk to your child about the book after (or while) reading it, then it would be bad!I&apos;m not saying, by the way, that this book is so awful and horrendous that the damage it does can&apos;t be undone by good parenting, communication, and discussion with your kids. It can, in fact, lead to worthwhile lessons, interesting conversations, and opportunities to transmit values.But then, finding a dead kitten on the road outside your house can do all those things, too. Doesn&apos;t mean that dead kittens are a good thing, you know?
    
  
        
      Well said.
    
  
        
      my second garde teacher she used to read this to me
    
  
        
      Ha you are nuts lol
    
  
        
      I&apos;m glad that Nathan Graham wrote this review. The irony of this book being read to children of Mothers in a shelter for battered woman seemed to escape the women who worked there and the women who ran the place. As far as it being only a children&apos;s book what you accept as normal and what you model for your children is what stays with them much closer than anything or anyone else. You don&apos;t see children picking up this book and reading it as much as you see an adult and a child.
    
  
        
      I&apos;ve got to second some of the other commenters here--to read this book as a model of love is, I think, to miss the point entirely. I grew up having this book read to me and never once did that occur to me. For me it was about growing old and leaving home, and the complexity of our relationships. Shel Silverstein is not a moralist, he doesn&apos;t deal in good and evil but what it means to be human. I think everyone has asked too much of a loved one at some point in their lives, Silverstein directs our attention to this truth. Also, comparing this book to finding a dead kitten is a tad bit hyperbolic don&apos;t you think?
    
  
        
      Love your comment. It really made me rethink the entire book. You&apos;re right, to just give and give until there&apos;s nothing but a tree stump left of you is not love, it&apos;s being a martyr. Many parents today live like martyrs, me included. This book actually tells a frightening story of giving and giving bug never getting anything back in return.
    
  
        
      I thought I was weird for not liking this book! Your review is spot on! It has conflicting messages and definitely not something I want my children to become enamored with.
    
  
        
      Yeah, this book is the worst! I never read it to kids at school. I agree 100%!
    
  
        
      I haven&apos;t read it - I was trying to find a book about a tree that I loved as a kid. This sure ain&apos;t it! I just read the synopsis and thought &quot;Ah no thanks, that sounds seriously deranged&quot;. Your review confirms my suspicion!
    
  
        
      Nathan thanks for your perpective. You may have just saved me a foutune in counseling fees :)... &lt;3 and light to u.
    
  
        
      If all these adults can&apos;t agree on the message of this book, how can a four year old be expected to grasp it? Want to teach kids about love and service? Read The Little Engine That Could. Clear message, happy story and bright, colorful pictures that will send them off to sleep with a smile on their face and the cheerful mantra, &quot;I think I can,&quot; running through their heads.
    
  
        
      I love this review! It&apos;s all the thoughts I have had, but expressed way better than I ever could.

      Is the controversy possibly based on a construed definition of unconditional love? If you read this book through the eyes of society it contains a completely different message than when read with the innocence of a child.
    
  
        
      Hilarious. Grown children bringing all of their biases and stacked preconceptions into the interpretation of a harmless children&apos;s book, and coming away unable to grasp a simple piece of art. I&apos;m sorry that you trust your children so little that you are terrified of them coming to their own conclusions about something you yourself have outgrown the ability to comprehend. If you were a better parent perhaps you wouldn&apos;t care what they grew up believing so long as they were smart about it. Something to think about.

This book is certainly a sort of sacred cow for many, that&apos;s certain.Everyone&apos;s mileage may vary, certainly. As for me, this book disturbed me when I was a kid and had it read to me. And as for my kids, my little daughter came home from grandma&apos;s house where it was read to her, asked why the boy was so mean to the tree, and said she didn&apos;t like the book because &quot;the boy chopped the tree up to pieces.&quot;Not the end of the world, certainly, and it surely didn&apos;t warp or ruin anyone -- no one has suggested any of that. You reach far and presume much with your obviously emotionally-skewed inferences about how much or how little we trust our children, much less the ones about what we can and cannot comprehend. And your saying that we should be better parents simply makes me suspect you&apos;re just a troll trying to get a rise out of people on a public board. Seriously, who discusses like that? Speaking of smart kids and proper upbringing, that is.Maybe it would actually be productive to speak in clear terms and without personal attacks. What is it you, Damon, feel we have failed to grasp?

Several here have made similar points, and I don&apos;t fully disagree -- perhaps it&apos;s not so much Silverstein&apos;s intentions I have a problem with, as the place and meaning this book has gained in our culture. You may not have had it pushed as a sweet story of love, but as far as I&apos;ve seen the vast majority of people have. Most children are introduced to this as, look how much the tree loves the boy, and look what love does to people. In my most cynical and bitter times I might agree, but it disturbs me to see love painted thus for children, even if that wasn&apos;t the author&apos;s intent.Comparing this book to finding a dead kitten is a tad bit hyperbolic don&apos;t you think?&quot;I&apos;ll concede to that, I suppose. Though I would say that a book depicting a child who chops a parent figure down with an axe, hacking off limbs and ultimately fashioning a vehicle from the corpse, isn&apos;t necessarily less viscerally disturbing than a dead cat.
    
  
        
      Amen!
    
  
        
      Wow- thanks for that review- i had never thought of the story that way. Even as a child, i always cried at the end- just like i did at the end if &quot;The Lorax&quot;- Suess&apos;s deep and woefully accurate portrayal of corporation&apos;s disregard for mother earth in their pursuit of money fueled by greed and the common attitude of some that our earth is here to use and abuse as we please since judgement day is near. As a overly sensitive emotional child, shy and tense even into adulthood, i never knew why it made me so sad until my mom, who happened to be a teacher would talk me thru my reaction, helping me to see why a nature and animal lover like myself would cry over a tree offering her last part to a bitter old man , and then still loving that little boy she still feels is somewhere inside the sad old man. She wants so bad to please him to help him be happy that she gives the only thing she has- herself. Sort of like the Lorax, i feel it is a sort if parable meant to help us feel what our earth would say if she could tell us to please stop raping her lands, oceans, and natural resources. Today the story is even more relevant with the threat of global warming- which one could say is our earth&apos;s way of warning us that it is imperative that we start taking care of her for our children, and that judgement day is the hoax, not Global Warming, and water shortages in the future. I admire Shel and Seuss for their brave, beautiful commentary on the choice we have as humans inhabiting this earth, to destroy or heal our planet.I tried reading the Lorax to my first graders- and asked them what the message was- not one of them could grasp it- so i know not many kids are as emotionally sensitive and/ or have a parent that helps them process their feelings or-reaction to a book. My mom really was a great mom, and still is and i thank her for bringing me up to be a secular humanist,which is what i wish all people would strive to be,
    
  
        
      Very interesting review.
    
  
        
      This review gave me a good perspective of the book I agree with you.
    
  
        
      It&apos;s not really hard to comprehend this book. It is clearly an anti example, and I&apos;m not sure how that was unclear to you as you say in your first post. The overwhelming majority of children come away repulsed by the child&apos;s actions. As it is a children&apos;s book I can&apos;t fathom why you would think the primary lesson would be one taken from an adult&apos;s perspective -- i.e., sacrificial love.
    
  
        
      Hello, Bart. Welcome to the &quot;We Disagree Therefore You&apos;re Stupid&quot; club. Please sit with your fellow club members over by the fountain.You said, &quot;The overwhelming majority of children come away repulsed.&quot; Which I&apos;ll assume you didn&apos;t do actual studies for and is thus anecdotal. Okay; maybe that&apos;s true. In my experience, most people remember this book fondly, referring to it as a sweet example of parental love and giving. Also anecdotal. Maybe that&apos;s true. Who the hell knows.But I&apos;m right. =)

      And hey, WDTYS club -- you are cordially invited to spread your wrath to my other reviews. Specifically, my review for the similarly horrifying book, &quot;Love You Forever&quot;, which you can read here: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...
    
  
        
      Spot on review! I never got why this book took off. It&apos;s just awful. LOL
    
  
        
      Spot on! I was assigned this book to read for my Lit for Youth class ...I understood the book was a children&apos;s classic. After reading it, I thought, &quot;Really!?&quot; This is a horrible book! It&apos;s cruel and vile! Firstly, That kid is rotten and mean. Secondly, the tree is loving, but the tree also has no self - respect or dignitity. I think it&apos;s a horrible book to give to children to read! As a librarian, I would never use this book for storytime.

           Co-dependent tree needs to set some fucking boundaries.
         
        
      LOL. Wow. Interesting reaction.
    
  
        
      So, what&apos;s your take on this widely loved book?
    
  
        
      Well, if memory serves, you have suggested that I have a care-taking pathology/predeliction, so this probably won&apos;t surprise you -- I&apos;m laughing rather hard over here -- but I totally adored that book. I&apos;ll add a caveat that I&apos;ve not read it since I was about 18. It was given to me a few years earlier by my ninth grade English teacher. I recall that the inscription read, &quot;an example of elegant simplicity at its best&quot; and, while I still agree with that assessment, I do actually recall being pretty distraught that the poor tree was such a sap, so to speak.
    
  
        
      I Know alot of parents that ack the same way
    
  
      Wow. Hate the book much? :) 
    
  
        
      YES INDEED.
    
  
        
      Hilarious comment; you made me bust up laughing-- thanks!
    
  
        
      I don&apos;t know why all these people totally HATE this book, but I think that it&apos;s a cute story and Silverstein did a great job on it!
    
  
        
      How could you say that?!? The book is a nice, loving tale about giving. It give children an example of kindness! It&apos;s not that bad, just because the boy was needy!
    
  
        
      i liked it too. it shows how the tree was being kind to the little boy about his needs. and i like the fact that this is a whole life time story in only 5 minutes. so be happy your not living the story.
    
  
        
      http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYQavD...
    
  
        
      Pretty much my thoughts summed up way more eloquently! I just reread this book and wow... that tree has issues. I don&apos;t think you can blame the boy since the tree is letting it all happen. &quot;Oh, take what I have. Oh, lonley me. Wah Wah Wah.&quot;
    
  
        
      I disagree with this review but DAMN, it made me laugh!
    
  
        
      ahaha!by far the funniest review ever.
    
  
        
      That may be that best review EVER!
    
  
        
      I refuse to buy this book for my daughter. I hate this book and would never recommend it to anyone.
    
  
        
      I am one of the people who finds this book either very sarcastic or truly misguided.
    
  
        
      You know the book is about his wife... How she always helped him through life and grow as a person until she died really young because of a hereditary brain disease. It&apos;s not about how life works in a parasitic relationship it&apos;s symbolism for how even though his wife died he is still able to live on and grow while cherishing her remaining tree stump of memories that remain there forever.
    
  
        
      I did not know that, Jaelyn. Thank you.It makes me wonder about how much we color a work when we read it ourselves. My lens sees this story to be about a toxic and unhealthy relationship. It makes me wonder how people interpret my own writing... would people read my own novel entirely different than intended.
    
  
        
      Oh my god I can&apos;t stop laughing!
    
  
        
      Why is that the best review ever? She sounds angry and bitter. A bad childhood? Neglected upbringing? Pity her.
    
  
        
      hey! that&apos;s mean. i like this book
    
  
        
      Best book review EVER. I wish I wrote it.
    
  
        
      Ahahah love your comment! I was thinking the same thing or more so of the men being selfish!
    
  
        
      I actually liked this book. But I love your comment!
    
  
        
      I agree! Awesome review.

      I&apos;m laughing at Olivia&apos;s comment. Projecting much? :-)
    
  
        
      You nailed it! Someone bought this for my daughter (I had never read it). Needless to say we donated it.

      Thank you! I feel there should be a club for those of us who realize how horrible this book is.
    
  
        
      Great comment and observation. For me, the boy represents those in society who feel entitled. The tree represents those in society who struggle to be the providers.

      I don&apos;t agree with you opinion about this book. But your review is one of the most entertaining I have ever read. I&apos;m still laughing. Thanks for your candour and your remarkable wit both.

      That is so immature of you to write that, especially about a book written for children. It seems to me that someone else needs to be setting boundaries..
    
  
        
      @Kasia, agreed.
    
  
        
      Seems to me that you need to get that stick out of your ass and remember this is a site for adults. The only boundaries here are the site&apos;s TOS, which this review didn&apos;t violate.Take your kindergarten teacher tone-policing elsewhere.
    
  
        
      Attacking the reviewer rather than debating the merits of the review is simpleminded and makes one look ridiculous, silly girl.

      Your comment was crystal clear, Cillian. You posted in my defense, so of course I was not addressing you. If only threaded discussions were allowed (or if I replied to posts in a more timely manner), we wouldn&apos;t have these misunderstandings.
    
  
        
      Wonderful review. You took the words right out of my mouth.
    
  
        
      Sava, &quot;attacking the reviewer&quot; ? Please. That&apos;s not an attack. It&apos;s my own opinion. Cillian, if your best line of defence is telling me to get a stick out of my ass, then you need to grow up. Everyone has different opinions. Just because I compelled disagree with the vulgar way Sava has reviewed this book, it doesn&apos;t mean I have a stick up my ass. At least be respectful and mature when defending yourself and others.

Every...&quot;You ask for respect after you came to shit on someone else&apos;s review space? Funny how the &quot;right to my opinion&quot; card trolls use never gets old for them. You flop on someone&apos;s thread, act like a jerk, and then whine about others being rude to you.You have the right to your opinion, save it for your own non-vulgar review. I also have to remind you this is not a kindergarten playground: it&apos;s a reading site where adults hang out.You&apos;re in the wrong place to police language. And your review is a fucking joke: you used your space to complain about the way others perceive this book instead of writing your own thoughts. If you want respect, start respecting others. Don&apos;t think yourself entitled to a respect you haven&apos;t earned.
    
  
        
      Oh Kasia, you sweet summer child. Calling me immature and that I need to set boundaries does not address my review. It is an attempt to insult me, the reviewer, whose review you didn&apos;t like. An attack and your opinion are not mutually exclusive. You can go fly your flag of indignation in your own front yard because your opinion is irrelevant.
    
  
        
      Oh Sava, you immature, wannabe mother. I am not your child to call names to. I am another human being who deserves to be addressed as one. Furthermore, my opinion is relevant because it address the writer of this review (you) and why I disagree with the review and in the way it was written. If my opinion was irrelevant, my opinion would not talk about you or your review. So before you make claims like that, clear your head.

           Scrolling down, it seems several reviewers resent this book&apos;s apparently heavy-handed message about selfishness/selflessness. I can totally understand why they find it upsetting or sappy. Overbearing, even. But I don&apos;t agree.Some fascinating theories have been put forth about The Giving Tree. It&apos;s deceptively simple on its surface, yes. But if this were truly just some hard and fast hippie dippy morality tale, would its two main characters (living natural tree, growing human boy) and their relationship have weathered such extensive interpretation over the years?Professor Timothy Jackson from Stanford University (found on Wiki): Is this a sad tale? Well, it is sad in the same way that life is sad. We are all needy, and, if we are lucky and any good, we grow old using others and getting used up... Our finitude is not something to be regretted or despised, however; it is what makes giving (and receiving) possible. The more you blame the boy, the more you have to fault human existence. The more you blame the tree, the more you have to fault the very idea of parenting. Should the tree&apos;s giving be contingent on the boy&apos;s gratitude? If it were, if fathers and mothers waited on reciprocity before caring for their young, then we would all be doomed.An admirable assessment from a theologian... although as a wee grub, my perception was different. My own folks, secular humanist scientists who taught me a &quot;recycle, reduce, reuse&quot; mantra at around age four, introduced me to The Giving Tree around the same time we started reading The Lorax. (Another seminal doozy!) Perhaps due to their influence on my early development, I came away from both books with a lot of very heavy, persistent questions concerning humanity&apos;s careless attitude towards ye olde Mother Earth. Without question, we&apos;re a species that generally takes and takes from the environment, thanklessly and thoughtlessly. Sadly this seems to be a trend that will continue until both we and the earth&apos;s resources are completely exhausted. (That is, unless we can all somehow convince ourselves AND our kids to turn it around.)Ever notice that throughout the course of the tale, the little boy just &quot;wants&quot; things from the tree? Only at the very end of his life does he actually &quot;need&quot; something from her... a place to rest for a moment, to be at peace. Anyhoo. Aspects of human behavior introduced to me in this book continue to flummox and obsess me in adulthood. Rereading it now only reinforces my lifelong desire to give something back to our weary but still beautiful mother earth, who seems to have no choice but to submit to our endless taking.Silverstein fable is empathetic and open-ended. At its core, it reflects humanity&apos;s short-sighted, often lifelong inability to distinguish want from need, but it does not damn us for it. 
         
        
      I have to admit, I&apos;ve read quite a few of your reviews, and I&apos;ve enjoyed them more than many of the books you&apos;ve reviewed (I&apos;m speaking mainly of this one and the review of the DaVinci Code. You&apos;ve explored some interesting angles, that I hadn&apos;t considered. Frankly, I still hate the book but you have made me think. Thanks,
    
  
        
      What&apos;s great about great literature is that people can read it and come away with different fitting messages for themselves. From your secular humanist environmentalist perspective, you took one message. From my Christian perspective, I originally took a very different one--a tale of Christ&apos;s all-givign, humiliating sacrifice for those who were yet in their sins, his willing suffering of abuse at the hands of those he loved. Shel Silversteen himself said he meant this as merely a tragic tale of how badly some people use others, and yet it has worked for readers on so many more levels than that. 
    
  
        
      This is an excellent review of one of the most important books in children&apos;s literature.I enjoyed reading it a lot. :)

           Yes, the boy is a selfish bastard, who doesn&apos;t deserve the love and generosity he gets time and again. Anyone who read this book as a child is well aware of this fact.Nonetheless, I&apos;m shocked to see how many disliked it. My only thought is that many readers allow their hatred for the boy to be confused with hatred for the book. Does the book condone the boy&apos;s behavior, or simply seek to tell a narrative? Does the quality of a book suffer when the moral quality of its characters flags?It is the job of narrative to relate a story. It is the job of a classic to relate a timeless story, to which countless readers of any age can relate. So whence the hatred? Is it because so many readers have known people who have taken and taken with such unrelenting fervor that they then displace this hatred onto a book that merely tells a story so fundamental it can&apos;t help but arouse feelings in any human who reads it?Silverstein, in my opinion, reached his peak with this book, so simple, and so pure, and more timeless than any book I can think of (at the moment).
         
        
      I completely agree. There seem to be two types of reviews for this book, passionate love and passionate hate, but I also notice that most of the hate reviews talk a great deal about how despicable the boy is. The boy is clearly not meant to be a role model. It&apos;s supposed to show us something we all have done in our lives, which is someone taking for granted someone else&apos;s love and sacrifices. Surely everyone as a child took for granted their parents sacrifices, and I&apos;m sure the metaphor applies to other relationships as well. The point is to remind us not to do that, to appreciate those who give to us. One other thread I see us people despising the tree for giving too much. There&apos;s a difference between raising a child with boundaries and loving that child unconditionally. You can certainly do both. In fact, if you&apos;re a parent, you should.
    
  
        
      I think it is a mark of a great story that illicits such a range of emotions in so many. It touches a core.
    
  
        
      A normal book wouldn&apos;t lose its quality just because a character is not moral. The problem is that this book is meant for kids, and they are supposed to learn their morality and values from this kind of books.

Whether the child sees it as bad or good depends on a variety of factors, most notably:1) how the immoral act affects those around the actor (i.e. other characters)2) how the act is depicted in the book/movie&apos;s tone3) how the act is seen by the important people in the child&apos;s life (i.e. the child&apos;s parents/family or, later, friends)So, if you, as a parent, are reading the book to your child, it&apos;s a perfect opportunity to talk to your child and express the act&apos;s immorality to the child.MORE IMPORTANT, though, is to consider the alternative: Children who are NOT exposed to any experience of a specific immoral act don&apos;t have any chance to form an opinion of its immorality. And the fewer cases of immoral actions a child gets exposed to, the less chance the child has to be able to dynamically figure out morality for themselves. They NEED to have a wide range of examples to draw from, in order to have a rich understanding of morality.

If a dog gets aggressive or defensive around black people (which is not uncommon), the solution is NOT to simply avoid the stimulus -- that just delays your having to face it... in fact, it can make it worse: if you react to their bristling neck-hairs by anxiously crossing the street, the dog subconsciously interprets that to mean that their defensive reaction was warranted.Same idea for children. AVOIDING contact with negative things merely prevents the child from learning about them, so that later, when the child/teenager IS exposed, he/she may be all too open to it.Sheltering the child is never the correct answer!
    
  
        
      Completely agree!
    
  
        
      yes! i agree!
    
  
        
      Yes! I completely agree!It would be great if parents took this book as an oportunity to talk and teach their children about these negative behaviours. But I think they seldom do, or at least I&apos;ve never seen it. It wasn&apos;t that way with me, my brothers or my friends. My parents say this is the most beautiful children s story. I don&apos;t remember the tree ever being affected by the child&apos;s actions. Even when he took everything from him, and then even sat on him. The tree was happy.It is as if I took everything from my parents, their money, their house, their love... everything. And then when they are old and tired, and in need of my help, I go and take more from them. I give nothing back and don&apos;t care about their feelings at all.Its all really subjective – as Charity said; some people love it and some people hate it. I find myself disgusted by it.
    
  
        
      The boy IS terrible to the tree, but that may be why I find it so touching. The tree gives the boy everything, even when there isn&apos;t anything left to give. The tree has such a passionate love for the boy, and it gives him things while asking for nothing in return. (Sigh) The boy may not be a role model, but the intense love the tree has for the boy is certainly something to wish for.
    
  
        
      Wow, I am so grateful to you for this wonderful review of this book that I have reviled most of my life. You are right, shel is illuminating a part of humanity--it is us who projects value/morality onto the tale like any good Rorschach.Thank you for illuminating this angle for me. It changes my entire experience of this book. I get it now.
    
  
        
      Exactly, Shel Silverstein was obviously successful at relaying his story if it is so famous that so many people know enough about it to discuss its merit so readily. Who says every children&apos;s book has to have a &quot;happy dappy&quot; ending? As a child, this book convicted me of being as selfish as the boy; therefore, the book did its job. It moved the reader to the point of change.
    
  
        
      Benjermin, I agree with you completely!!!
    
  
        
      The finest assessment of the boy&apos;s behavior came from my kindergartener: &quot;He&apos;s dumb. He should make his OWN house!&quot; I am glad to say her take was: self-sufficiency is better than selfishness. That this simple story elicited that thoughtful response tells me the story is priceless. -- and in view my daughter&apos;s insight is more profound than most of the snarky negative reviews of the book by adults.
    
  
        
      Would you be a stump for anyone in your life? Would you for your children or your parents if they required it?
    
  
        
      stop swearing
    
  
        
      I think this book is a really sweet and heartfelt story.

      I gotta read this one :)
    
  
        
      P, I can&apos;t imagine anyone not loving this story, although it&apos;s sad. Made me tear up the first time I read it.
    
  
        
      A childhood favorite!

      Thank you Carol! :D
    
  
        
      Some of these kid books are much more rewarding than a lot of the adult &quot;bestsellers&quot; out there. Nice review, Mischenko!
    
  
        
      For sure Christine! Thank you :)

           This book review is now available on my blog at https://www.skylarb.com/single-post/2...
         
        
      Whoa I totally agree with what you are saying. This was one of my favorite books to read growing up. It was very different from anything I had read before and really made think. I had no idea so many other people had read it or that were so many different ideas about what it meant. I just wanted to thank you for writing such a thought provoking review. 
    
  
        
      Just want to say the pic on your profile page--you have an amazing smile--you made me smile! thank you!
    
  
      I, too, like your analysis of this book. I think the book has meant different things to me at different times of my life. It&apos;s not a happy book, but it doesn&apos;t mean I can&apos;t love it for what it is.
    
  
        
      The world is not always a beautiful place. I think you hit it spot on. My son cried when I read this book to him, and I think that was the appropriate response to the story.
    
  
        
      I admit I do not like this book, but your analysis is very thoughtful, and has made me see the book a bit differently. Your comparison of our attitudes to contemporary vs. classic children&apos;s literature is compelling. Thanks.
    
  
        
      Funny, I think in some ways I am like your daughter. I requested it be read to me over and over again as a little girl, but as I grew older what stayed with me was the terribleness and sorrow for the poor tree. I think, possibly, that is what drew me to the book as a young child, that fascination with the fact that there is no happy ending. I like to chew my books, now that I&apos;m older, to have some part of the story not quite fit right for me, something I have to mull over and kind of figure out why it&apos;s bothering me. I think that even then I was doing that, in my own small way, by listening to that book over and over again and grappling with what it contained. It definitely made me a deeper thinker, I&apos;d say, and maybe even began my love for books that don&apos;t end &quot;picture perfectly.&quot;
    
  
        
      Jaina, I think the book may have influenced me similarly in my younger years.
    
  
        
      Cute baby in your picture there.
    
  
        
      Thanks. He&apos;s mine. (Though the picture is from years ago...)
    
  
        
      Yes, it was a little bit sad, but otherwise, it was pretty good.
    
  
        
      An intelligent, thoughtful review, worthy of the book. Thank you.

           So it is Christmas time, and my wife likes to have all of us—my wife and I, and our three years old twins—do a different event each night during Advent as a family. I like this practice; it is little things like this that keep our family strong. Tonight’s event was reading Christmas themed books.We decided to read THE GIVING TREE as well as three other Christmas books. Had I foreseen what was about to transpire I would have omitted THE GIVING TREE from my selection.Allow me to replay said event:The setting: Mommy and Daddy&apos;s bed.After a torturous time of getting my kids to brush their teeth, put on their pajamas, and convinced that they should only bring two stuffed animals apiece to bed, I began to read the books. The first book went well. The kids laughed. My wife and I smiled. The second book was just as good as the first book. More laughter. More smiles. Then it was time for THE GIVING TREE. Now I’ve read all of Shel Silverstein’s books. I find them quite enjoyable and zany and creative. THE GIVING TREE was no different. Or so I thought. You see, I never really paid much attention to the story. Well that’s not entirely true. I have always liked the message about giving when others are constantly taking. And Christmas time is a perfect time to share this message. But my son, Noah, interpreted the book differently. As I read the book I focused on how the little boy grows into a man and loses his innocence of giving, taking on a more selfish attitude. My son saw the boy growing older. When the tree gave everything but its stump to the boy as a man, I saw this as a generous message of charity. Noah saw it as the man killing the tree. But that’s not all.An excerpt of the night:Me: The End. That was a good story.Noah: I didn’t like it.Me: Why? The tree was very generous, and the man realized that he had only taken and never given back.Noah: (Staring blankly at me as if I had just finished reading him my bank statement.)Me: What didn’t you like about the story?Noah: The boy grows old and kills the tree and is now going to die.Me: (Inwardly: SSSSSHHHHHHHHIIIIIIIIIIITTTTTTTTTTTTT!!!!!!!!!! The death subject.)Me: No, honey. The tree gave its branches and trunk to the man—Noah: The boy killed the tree. And now the boy is old and is going to die.Me: No, buddy. The tree just changed. And the little boy lived a long life—Noah: And now he is going to die.Me: (FFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUCCCCCCCCCKKKKKKKKKKKK!!!!!!!!!! Inwardly, of course.) So having no other way to combat my son’s determination to prove that the tree was murdered and that the little boy was now an old man and was going to die soon, I did what every father should do in this matter.Me: Ask Mommy what she thinks, buddy. 
         
        
      Heck. My kid thinks that way too. His thoughts can be so bendy compared to others. And it IS DIFFICULT to reason those perceptions of his away. Sometimes dang near impossible. You did good. He most likely went to bed mulling over your words and came to some sort of happier understanding. If all else fails, remind him it&apos;s just a story some guy made up. It&apos;s not all that important on the big scheme of things. Hee hee you&apos;ve got you an independent thinker there, for better and for worse. Congats!
    
  
        
      Briliant review. Have just bought this for my great nephew and then had a quick look. Good grief. I wholly concur with your wise young son and if I send it on to my niece it will be with the proviso she doesn&apos;t give it to him until he is at least 30
    
  
        
      I had a similar experience reading this book to my 5 year old son. After reading the last page, he was very sad for the old man and the tree. Mostly for the tree. His first question was &quot;why do we have to die?&quot; and then, after an unsatisfactory answer from me, &quot;but why do we have to grow, why can&apos;t we stay the way we are forever?&quot; It lead to a pretty heavy conversation and he went to sleep thinking about it. I was actually happy trying to answer his difficult questions, having a deep conversation with my kid. Not all stories need to have a &apos;happy ending&apos;.

      Gavin, have you read the parody &apos;The taking Tree&apos; by Shrill Travesty ? It is brilliant.
    
  
        
      I agree! I remember thinking of it as killing the tree when I was younger. Very disturbing!

      When I was little I had the same kind of perception but I&apos;ve always been very introverted and for a while i think I took it to heart and thought about life and getting older a lot. Lol I wanted to think really deeply about it but eventually I just accepted it and I&apos;ve decided over time that growing up isn&apos;t that bad. It goes so slow anyway
    
  
        
      Thanks so much for this review. I was going to get this for my daughter, but I can see the exact same thing happening at our house. Problem is....I&apos;m the Mommy! I won&apos;t be getting this one.
    
  
        
      I think your son had it right. The boy/man never learned any lesson and remained selfish to the point where he killed the tree. Sometimes children really do see to the truth of a matter.
    
  
        
      What a great little story of a story. Thank you TK421.

           I think that the failure not only of Children&apos;s Literature as a whole, but of our very concept of children and the child&apos;s mind is that we think it a crime to challenge and confront that mind. Children are first protected from their culture--kept remote and safe--and then they are thrust incongruously into a world that they have been told is unsafe and unsavory; and we expected them not to blanch.It has been my policy that the best literature for children is not a trifling thing, not a simplification of the adult or a sillier take on the world. Good Children&apos;s literature is some of the most difficult literature to write because one must challenge, engage, please, and awe a mind without resorting to archetypes or life experience.Once a body grows old enough, we are all saddened by the thought of a breakup. We have a set of knowledge and memories. The pain returns to the surface. Children are not born with these understandings, so to make them understand pain, fear, and loss is no trivial thing. The education of children is the transformation of an erratic and hedonistic little beast into a creature with a rational method by which to judge the world.A child must be taught not to fear monsters but to fear instead electrical outlets, pink slips, poor people, and lack of social acceptance. The former is frightening in and of itself, the latter for complex, internal reasons. I think the real reason that culture often fears sexuality and violence in children is because they are such natural urges. We fear to trigger them because we cannot control the little beasts. We cannot watch them every minute.So, to write Children&apos;s Literature, an author must create something complex and challenging, something that the child can turn over in their mind without accidentally revealing some terrible aspect of the world that the child is not yet capable of dealing with. Carroll did this by basing his fantasies off of complex, impersonal structures: linguistics and mathematical theory. These things have all the ambiguity, uncertainty, and structure of the grown-up world without the messy, human parts.This is also why the Alice stories fulfill another requirement I have for Children&apos;s Lit: that it be just as intriguing and rewarding for adults. There is no need to limit the depth in books for children, because each reader will come away with whatever they are capable of finding. Fill an attic with treasures and the child who enters it may find any number of things--put a single coin in a room and you ensure that the child will find it, but nothing more.Of course, we must remember that nothing we can write will ever be more strange or disturbing to a child than the pure, unadulterated world that we will always have failed to prepare them for. However, perhaps we can fail a little less and give them Alice. Not all outlets are to be feared, despite what your parents taught you. In fact, some should be prodded with regularity, and if you dare, not a little joy. 
         
        
      What a stirring review. I was riveted. I hope you are a lit teacher or a professional writer so that many people hear what you have to say and the beauty with which you say it.
    
  
        
      I am unemployed in every conceivable regard. While this may not separate me from your average professional writer, I&apos;m afraid I feel quite separate from them by the difficulty I have in finishing any writing. That is to say: the difficulty I have ever had with ever being satisfied by what I do.Your kind words rekindle the memory of old hopes in my breast, but it&apos;s been a while since I dared to dream that I might ever make a living with writing. Indeed, I find it hard enough to make a living with living.I&apos;m glad if you enjoyed something I&apos;ve made, and thank you for it.
    
  
        
      After roughly a year of comment, I intrude now in an attempt to reverse any doubt regarding your writing ability (and because I was looking for anti-keely quotes). There are so many inadequate and mediocre &quot;professional&quot; reviewers out there, and I think you have a real chance at getting to where you wanted to go. 
    
  
        
      Thanks for the vote of confidence, but I wouldn&apos;t hold your breath waiting for people to start lining up to read what I have to write.And anyways, if it takes people a year to decide whether I&apos;m any good, they&apos;ll probably just buy someone else&apos;s book.
    
  
        
      Good point, but i&apos;ve never seen this review before(If that&apos;s what you meant). 
    
  
        
      Interesting thoughts lost in an sea of murky syntax.
    
  
        
      ; 
    
  
        
      Interesting comment irrelevant to the topic at hand. Or rather at hand months ago.
    
  
        
      If you&apos;re talking about Lisa&apos;s comment, I think it was aimed purely at the original review.
    
  
        
      Yes, I was. But only because we actually did have murky syntax.
    
  
        
      Syntax looks concise enough to me. It&apos;s no Bierce, but I don&apos;t see any hyphens out of place.
    
  
        
      Fine, the murky syntax belongs to me 
    
  
        
      the child can test and turn over in their mind??? also the same sentence confuses process with result, I think. I&apos;m not sure what &quot;the process of Children&apos;s Literature&quot; is. It sounds important, but it&apos;s not clear to me that it means anything.Otherwise, I like the basic ideas here.
    
  
        
      Mmm, guess I do have some murky syntax. I was trying to indicate that the children would recieve ideas that they could then explore within the mind: testing them, turning them over to look at all sides. The latter should probably have read &quot;the process of writing Children&apos;s Literature&quot;.Thanks. There&apos;s always more editing to be done.
    
  
        
      Glad there&apos;s someone else there who expects more from children, and don&apos;t worry about your English, no problems there. Hope you enjoy Alice.
    
  
        
      Very interesting review. I have no children, but I agree with your thoughts, and found your words very near to my point of view. Thank you.
    
  
        
      Thanks for the kind comment, I&apos;m glad you enjoyed my review.
    
  
        
      Awesome review, Keely. Quite the intellectual, if I may say so myself. Your thoughts are right on the money.
    
  
        
      This is one of my favorite reviews that I&apos;ve written--one of those where I go through and read it and feel like it was written by someone else. Glad it resonated with you.
    
  
        
      I poked a knife in an outlet and learned a valuable lesson.
    
  
        
      I hope it was about the true meaning of friendship.
    
  
        
      Murky syntax or no, there are far worse writers who get paid for their work. One would be ill advised to wait for perfection before taking the next step towards one&apos;s dreams... it&apos;s an unfortunate habit I catch myself in often. I&apos;m not entirely sure that Alice teaches that one outright, but it&apos;s a life lesson I&apos;m finding quite valuable these days. Anyhow. I enjoyed your review, this sentence: &quot;We must remember that nothing we can come up with will be more strange or disturbing to a child than the pure, unadulterated world that we will always have failed to prepare them for,&quot; particularly struck home for me. Since graduating from college over a year ago, I have found myself quite paralyzed with fear of that pure, unadulterated world and am only just beginning to face it again with strength drawn from the stories of characters progressing through their own strange, confusing and sometimes terrible journeys.
    
  
        
      &quot; . . . there are far worse writers who get paid for their work.&quot;It&apos;s true, but part of the reason I still find the world rather paralyzing is that a person&apos;s skill seems to bear little to no relation to how much they are paid. Indeed, to be truly successful, one must practice mediocrity, not excellence.&quot;. . . with strength drawn from the stories of characters progressing through their own strange, confusing and sometimes terrible journeys.&quot;Such stories are indeed inspirational, which makes it all the more depressing that the majority of stories show people easily succeeding. Perhaps if we had more stories that showed heroes dealing with hardship and failure, we might be better at facing it, ourselves.Thank you for your comment, I&apos;m glad you liked the review.
    
  
        
      From what I&apos;ve seen of the world, it&apos;s not mediocrity that leads to success but superiority in determination, networking and skill at business (the latter two can be learned, thankfully). Unfortunately, the quality of the product or service rendered can fall second to these things, but this does not mean one cannot succeed as well- if not better with a quality product or skill than one can with a mediocre one. This is not to say some compromise may need to be made, with anything one sells, the needs of the consumer must also be taken into account and balanced against the creator&apos;s ideal vision for his or her product.
    
  
        
      Those traits certainly do help in business, but they will only take you so far. I suppose it depends what you mean by &apos;success&apos;. I&apos;ve known some Type-A personalities who were set to take the business world by storm, who had determination and skill in spades, but who eventually hit a ceiling.Sure, they had fairly good jobs and did competent work, and if you consider that success, then sure, but from what I know of the politics of success in business, being &apos;good at your job&apos; only gets you so far. There are other factors than those which seem to be much more important if you desire to control your own fate in the business world.One of these is having connections--not merely being able to network, but having people who are willing to go over other people&apos;s heads to give you a position even if you don&apos;t have as much experience or as many qualifications as other applicants. Often, this falls under &apos;nepotism&apos;. Secondly there is the ability to &apos;play the game&apos;, meaning taking credit for the successes of those you manage, and making them the scapegoats for any failures.There&apos;s a rather interesting article about this dynamic, The Gervais Principle, which takes insights from the classic books on politics and communication in business and uses examples from the American TV show &apos;The Office&apos; to illustrate how these theories play out.But when I was talking about mediocrity overcoming excellence, I was talking about product, not about producers. Namely, that people who get their books published are rarely the most skilled writers--often they are not particularly skilled at all. And of those books which are published, the ones that are the most successful (read: sell the most copies) are almost never exceptional, because the average person is neither looking for nor capable of recognizing an exceptional book.There is a similar problem in business: for the best person to get the job, the person in charge of giving out jobs must be able to recognize which applicant is actually the best. This is immediately problematic because the people who hire and promote almost never have the skills necessary to recognize who is &apos;best&apos;.Imagine there is a position open for a computer coder, and the manager must promote one of the coders he employs. If he doesn&apos;t understand the intricacies of coding, how can he pick the best coder? How can he judge who was responsible for what? Who created the successful pieces, and who the flawed ones? Who was the most efficient, overall?It&apos;s a problem I ran into often while working at a big multinational: our bosses simply couldn&apos;t tell who was doing the better work, because they were not versed in the intricacies of that work. In the end, it tended to come down to which one of us looked like we were working the hardest, not the most determined or skilled, but who was most able to take credit and avoid blame.Likewise, the average reader is not in a good position to judge who the best writers are. The channels through which they become aware of books are not based on which writers are best, but which writers have the biggest marketing budget. The ability to judge the quality of writing is limited by experiences which, for the average reader, will be small. So it makes sense that, looking back over the centuries, the best writers were often unknown in their own time, while the bestsellers of the past are nearly all forgotten today.The publishing world begins to resemble a Walmart economy, where a plethora of low-quality goods are marketed heavily to an uninformed public who responds to familiarity and convenience and is unable to judge quality.It&apos;s true that a company can find success with a high-quality product, but since most people cannot judge quality at the time of purchase, on average, mediocre products will tend to perform as well as good ones, and since it costs a company more time and money to create a good product, mediocre products will seem the more attractive option.This is especially true if the company can still market the mediocre product as a good one and charge a large price for it, such as in the case of extremely expensive speaker cables. On one instance, the cable creators split the cable into two signals to &apos;maintain fidelity&apos; despite the fact that the split cables fed into a single plug on either end, meaning that they were splitting and recombining a single signal and claiming it somehow aided fidelity. It makes about as much sense as cutting a Christmas present in two before mailing it in hopes it will increase the chances of each piece getting there unharmed.But I digress. As long as the public is mostly unable to judge good from bad, and as long as their contact with new products is governed mainly by the size of marketing budgets, there&apos;s no reason to think that the quality of my writing will have anything to do with my ability to be employed as a writer. Luckily, my motivation for writing has nothing to do with the promise of employment.Thanks for your comment, sorry for the overly long reply, and good luck with your own &apos;strange, confusing, and sometimes terrible journey&apos;.
    
  
        
      All of this was interesting to read. Except for the negative comment about syntax. Who asked her opinion? ;)A number of things hit home for me. 1) I am a mom and I do hope to do the best job I can to prepare my sons for life. 2) I think unemployment is a choice one makes. There are many mediocre jobs to be had if only just to pay for food and shelter. One may not be living their dreams but one can work towards it. I apologize if this sounds harsh but I say it with love. You (Keely) sound intelligent enough to hold a steady paying job. It may not be something you want to do but it can be a starting point. I&apos;m still working on number 3 or more insights of mine to share but as I mentioned, I&apos;m a mom of 2 boys and I&apos;m lucky to get 5 minutes alone. ;)
    
  
        
      &quot;There are many mediocre jobs to be had if only just to pay for food and shelter.&quot;You&apos;re lucky that this has been your experience, I know it&apos;s not true for everyone. Then again, the unemployment rate in the NYC area is about twice as bad as it is, nationally, so that is part of it. There&apos;s also the fact that, as an educated, middle-class person, there are a lot of lower-end jobs that you simply won&apos;t be hired for, because the person doing the hiring thinks of you as &apos;over qualified&apos; and expects that you&apos;ll leave the job quickly, especially if it is unpleasant, unrewarding work.I&apos;ve had friends with education, experience, and training put out hundreds of resumes every year, only get half a dozen responses, and then never get called back for any of those jobs, despite the fact that many were mediocre, lower-level jobs for which they were over-qualified.&quot;You (Keely) sound intelligent enough to hold a steady paying job.&quot;I agree, but that doesn&apos;t mean I&apos;ll be hired in the first place. I&apos;ve had several jobs in the years since that first comment--one of which even required some literary writing--but every one of those was a job I got through someone I knew on the inside, not a response to sending my resume out or applying. Unfortunately, several of these jobs were seasonal, and for others, the business was forced to close.Again, I think you&apos;re lucky if you&apos;ve always been able to find work if you needed it, because that hasn&apos;t been the experience of most people I know. Maybe you think unemployment is a choice, but tell that to friends of mine who applied to two jobs a day for a year and never get hired.Thanks for the comment, and do feel free to add any other insights, if you find the time.
    
  
        
      Hmmm, I might be imagining it, but I have a feeling you wrote a very similar review for Alice in Wonderland,(as a standalone) which I &quot;liked&quot; and commented on. Nevermind, it deserves a &quot;like&quot; so now you have another like on this one as well. :)
    
  
        
      Haha, yes. I copy/pasted it to Wonderland, Looking-Glass, and this combined edition so friends and followers could see it even if they had rated a different version.
    
  
        
      I like this review better than Wonderland&apos;s series of disjointed randomness.
    
  
        
      Actually, the Alice stories aren&apos;t random, they are a mixture of satire on the mathematics of &apos;imaginary numbers&apos; which was being developed in Carroll&apos;s time and playing with linguistic structures and meanings.
    
  
        
      Lucky I decided to read this review of yours and then the comments.Judging by the comments that you made above,I think that we have a similar view point of the world.I see in you a smarter and more experienced version of me,although the final realization that being good at what you do doesn&apos;t guarantee a successful career is disheartening.I guess I&apos;ll have to try and become very good in the field that I have chosen and see how that goes.
    
  
        
      It is disheartening to realize that simply being good at something doesn&apos;t mean you&apos;ll be successful. I remember when I realized that, and it was a difficult lesson to learn.I was a &apos;gifted&apos; child and all I ever got from my teachers was praise. I drifted through school and never felt challenged. I remember being surprised and confused as a young man in college when I realized that no one was going to give me a job for being smart.Then I got into the working world and realized that a lot of people who get hired are not that good at their jobs. There is a minimum level of skill in order to be hired, but it&apos;s not the primary reason people get hired. People get hired because of who they know and how good they are at marketing themselves. It&apos;s often just a question of how a person spends their time: imagine one person spends 90% of their time studying in their field and 10% trying to improve their employment, then imagine someone who spends 10% of their time studying and 90% on self-promotion. Which one is going to be better at the job? Which one is more likely to get the job?The system is not built around getting the most qualified people into the bets positions, it&apos;s built around short-term profits, and employees get treated the same way as products. Finding and hiring the most intelligent people would be time-consuming and expensive, so it&apos;s easier for companies to hire mediocre people who will do the bare minimum. It&apos;s like how it&apos;s easier for a company to sell a cheap product for a quick profit rather than spend years of research to make a high-quality, expensive product with a lower margin of profit.I remember reading the autobiography of Kerry Mullis, Nobel Prize winner for discovering polymerase chain reaction. Like many scientists, he spent years working for industry because it paid better than academia. One day he pulled a bottle of NaCl off of the shelf and noticed there was a warning on it which talked about the dangers of sodium and chlorine gas, which are both deadly.Yet when they bond together, they form table salt, which is completely harmless. How can a company hire the best scientists, judge the work they do, and create a good working environment if they don&apos;t know the difference between a weaponized gas and a food additive? And that&apos;s been my experience in business: the people in charge don&apos;t have enough knowledge of the day-to-day running of the company to recognize the best candidates.In the end, I decided it&apos;s more important to me to be good at what I do, I just don&apos;t expect to become wealthy doing it. I would rather be a skilled author with no job than a crap author with bestsellers, which is why I&apos;m one of those people who are 90% study, 10% promotion.I think it comes down to the same thing for most people, because there are only so many hours in a day, and you have to choose how to spend them. Some people think it&apos;s worthwhile to work long hours doing something that means nothing to them in order to be paid a certain wage. For others, they would rather struggle making little money at a job that challenges and interests them.For me, it&apos;s the latter. I have the same rule for jobs as for books: if I don&apos;t come away from it knowing and understanding more than I did when I started, it wasn&apos;t worth my time. In any case, thanks for the comment, and I hope you will be able to take pride in being good at what you do, regardless of whether you get recognition for it.
    
  
        
      Dude same here,I count school as a massive waste of time.I did really well without breaking a sweat and learned nothing which will help me in life,which is the reason I hate my country&apos;s education system.On your comments on the industry,I&apos;m totally with you.Just a few weeks ago I was wondering what else I can do if I don&apos;t make it as a contemporary dancer outside of India in a country with an evolved dance culture and one where mediocre people are not sitting at the top(if everything goes as planned,I will be in NYC in September,we should meet),the exact same thought struck my mind.I can&apos;t expect people to hire me just because I&apos;m smart.Also,how can I prove to them that I&apos;m smart,if they don&apos;t know how to sense it.I&apos;m somewhat of a rationalist and I believe the most important things that should be taught to kids and teens while they are at school is thinking critically along with concentration(emptying your mind and being like water in Bruce Lee&apos;s words) and finally,giving them the facts of life,free of a final opinion,and letting them judge it.It sounds idealistic but I think this is what we should strive for(this is my opinion as of now,completely open to debate and modification),although I can&apos;t see how it&apos;s possible to try and bring something along these ideals in India where there are many different religions and religious views are given a lot of importance.And one other of our similarities,along with our thoughts and interests(I checked your interests in your profile and they are similar to mine),is that I too would rather work on improving my skills and not marketing.Although I am a little lazy and can&apos;t utilize the free time I have as well as I should,a habit for which an aimless first fifteen years of my life are most probably at blame as my parents are hard working folk,in case laziness is hereditary.
    
  
        
      I don&apos;t feel like school was a waste for me--I tried to get as much out of it as I could--but it&apos;s true that it could have been much better. I sometimes wonder what I could be today if I had been in an institution that challenged me to the limit of my talents and intelligence.It&apos;s very cool that you are a dancer, do let me know if you end up in the area. It actually reminds me of another story about people with skill and determination being screwed over. I read an article by a woman who is a hip-hop dancer, and who would often try out for tours and shows in NYC. The choreographer would always come up to her and say they were looking forward to working with her, but then, she wouldn&apos;t get the job.Eventually she found out that the pop stars or directors were mostly disregarding the choreographer and picking people based on their look, even if they weren&apos;t great dancers. She was always losing out to people with dyed mohawks and tattoos, and people in the business were saying since she was a pretty white girl, she should try out to become a cheerleader, as if that was the same thing.But I&apos;m not trying to be a downer--there are a lot of ways to define success, and there are a lot of ways to find a satisfying life. I never thought I would end up working in theater, but I did, for a while.I agree with what you say about teaching kids, though I would add that they also need to learn self-reliance, which means giving them challenges they have to complete on their own, starting with small things and working up to larger things. It&apos;s also important that these be things they might fail, so they learn how to deal with both success and failure in life. I know I didn&apos;t get a chance to be responsible for myself until college, and it was very difficult to learn it that late.I&apos;m not familiar with the particulars of religious life in India--what you say sounds interesting.You mention laziness, and I also used to define myself this way, though in looking at psychological theory, I came to understand a different motivation for my procrastination: perfectionism. It&apos;s apparently common for perfectionists to procrastinate, because when they look at a task, they see something extremely large and complex to be done, and don&apos;t feel they have the time and energy to do it properly. So, instead of just doing a mediocre job, which would infuriate them, they avoid the task altogether. I often have to remind myself that any work towards a goal, no matter how small, is a good thing, and that completing something mediocre is better than not finishing anything at all.
    
  
        
      I think that&apos;s the difference,you tried.I sat on my couch and became a fat,lazy ass.Thank god puberty set in,made me notice girls and I started to think how to attract them.Then soon,the focus shifted from girls to personal growth.I think it&apos;s a little ironical that puberty which is dreaded by many parents actually helped me realize what I want in life.And have thought about the same thing sometimes,about an institution giving me a more challenging environment,although I am still somewhat satisfied.In a way,the incompetence of the education system was a challenge for me to overcome and I&apos;m glad I did,not as soon as I would have wanted to,but I think still have a good long life ahead(my grandparents lived into their nineties),if no accidents happen.As for looks being an issue in the dance industry,it is saddening.This is prevalent in both commercial and non commercial spheres,a friend of mine went to Argentina for a ballet workshop at the Colon theater and he met a very talented dancer there,with a good solid technique but short in height.He was thinking of quitting dance as a career option because he couldn&apos;t find any jobs.I read that even Baryshnikov didn&apos;t get primary roles in Russia because of his less than ideal height!I&apos;m with you again on self reliance,I&apos;m yet to learn it.As far as failure is concerned,in India many students get low marks are often depressed because of that as the parents and teachers put a lot of emphasis on them,they don&apos;t need any more lessons in failure.I think what they need is,like you said,learning how to deal with it.I think depression would be seen only in rare cases if everyone is taught how to do that.It&apos;s easy to fall into a self depreciating mode,victimize yourself and blame everyone else for your failures.Emptying the mind of thoughts is very tough in these situations but works like a charm,cures insomnia too.Another children&apos;s book I rate highly is Wee Free Men by Terry Pratchett,it focuses exactly on these things,developing critical thinking and taking responsibility.I know you don&apos;t like Pratchett much,but according to me you read the books he wrote at the start of his career.I read Mort which is the fourth book he wrote and was terribly disappointed.Small Gods is my favorite and I would suggest that you give him another chance and read the two I mentioned.If you don&apos;t like these,I don&apos;t think you&apos;ll enjoy any other book of his and also,I would like to hear what you have say about them.Maybe you&apos;ll notice things I missed(I&apos;m biased towards him,so it&apos;s probable that I chose to ignore the flaws).Coming to acting,my dad does Hindi(my native language) theater,I&apos;ve seen many plays and I didn&apos;t really like any of the actors.I just read An Actor&apos;s work by Stanislavsky,I really liked what he had to say and I think India needs someone like him to raise the bar and bring realism into acting.I read many blogs to get acquainted with the opinions of people outside of India and working in acting industry,there were a few who thought that his methods are now outdated and easier methods have been evolved.I would like to hear what you have to say.Regarding laziness,this a new angle you have given me to look at things from,will keep this in mind next time I feel like procrastinating.
    
  
        
      &quot;. . . a friend of mine went to Argentina for a ballet workshop at the Colon theater and he met a very talented dancer there,with a good solid technique but short in height.&quot;Oh yeah, definitely. It&apos;s just sad the way the Balanchine type is still adhered to at so many schools and troupes.&quot;I know you don&apos;t like Pratchett much,but according to me you read the books he wrote at the start of his career.&quot;It&apos;s true, and people have suggested I try other ones. I probably will, some day, we&apos;ll see how it goes. thanks for the suggestion.&quot;I just read An Actor&apos;s work by Stanislavsky,I really liked what he had to say . . .&quot;Ah, interesting. I am interested in realist and method forms, being a fan of Chekhov, but I am not well-versed in the theory or the specific schools of thought. As I said, I didn&apos;t expect to get a job in theater, I just fell into it. My background is mostly literary, and the acting I have done has been mostly extemporaneous and not really steeped in methodology and theory. I guess that&apos;s something else I should start studying.Thanks for the comments, feel free to post more or message me if you have anything else on your mind.
    
  
        
      Nice,you&apos;re a man of many talents.Will look forward to your opinion if you do read some books on acting.Thanks for your time,take care.
    
  
        
      Drat, Keely, I&apos;ve already liked this review.But you&apos;ve had a few other comments sprout up.Totally off-topic but related to Akash&apos;s comment up but one, aesthetics aside, it&apos;s rather awkward being an average-sized dancer en pointe with a shorter male partner. The guy can&apos;t provide any support for certain steps. That&apos;s why most of Lec Trocs dancers are short males, with a few tall guys who act as the partners.
    
  
        
      I agree with you, but being short has advantages too, a significant one being a sharper petite allegro. I understand the aesthetic limitations of companies too, they want the dancers in corps to look similar. I just feel disheartened when talent goes unappreciated, and that guy was not able to find any jobs. I haven&apos;t thought much on how this ideal body type issue in dancing can be resolved, but I hope it does get sorted out in the future.Also, I am sure there are talented girls who didn&apos;t take dancing professionally as they were short in height, he would have been able to provide adequate support to them. Things in life are not ideal, but I feel we should always keep striving, only then can we grow and have some sort of fairness in this world.
    
  
        
      I&apos;m sorry to hear that you haven&apos;t had much success in your work--goodness knows, based on what I&apos;ve seen of your writing, you are much more deserving than most who manage to be published.I thoroughly enjoyed your review. You express yourself very well, and with great insight, on a topic which is dear to my heart. I hope you won&apos;t give up on your writing! You never know when your lucky break could come, and it would be a sad thing if you kept all you have to offer the reading world to yourself. :)
    
  
        
      Great review as usual! I absolutly agree on the importance of complex and layered children&apos;s litterature. There are few things that are as rewarding as when you return to your childhood favoruites and find new meaning and comfort in them, and few things as sad as when you find them dated and shallow. There is one part I didn&apos;t quite get though: &quot;A child must be taught not to fear monsters but to fear instead electrical outlets, pink slips, poor people, and lack of social acceptance. The former is fr</obo:OWLDataProperty_00000000000000000051>

           THIS BOOK IS MY DREAM.It’s Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, plus Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There, plus a ton of critical analysis and fun facts and biographical info and poetry and background and cultural and period information and bonus illustrations and basically all you need or could ever want to know, except if you’re me and your love for and curiosity about Alice and Lewis Carroll and Wonderland will never be satiated.And also it’s about a square yard and the font is tiny and it weighs about 30 pounds and takes an eternity to read.I loved this so much that it made my heart hurt to finish it. My version of paradise is probably something like this, where I’m alternating between reading the original text I love more than anything and eloquent, wise, humorous elaboration on things I had never known. The more I learned, the more I wanted to know.I guess you could say I grew…curiouser and curiouser.I love myself.Anyway, my bookmark for this book was a folded-up sheet of lined paper on which I wrote down the titles and works of art and research queries I wanted to know more about as I read. I filled up both sides of that sheet.Absolutely every aspect of this book is gorgeous and curated and fascinating. I don’t really know how to review this because it basically transcended reading for me. It was just a perfect experience.Bottom line: If you love Alice like I do, or really really like it, you need to read this book. It’s a gift. That’s all I can say.-----------pre-reviewi have never, in my entire life, cried in public over a book.until today.THIS BOOK MADE ME CRY IN PUBLIC!more of a review to come??

      I have loved this book for years! More people need to know about it.Also here is a link to an Alice/Jabberwock short story that you might like: http://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fic...I know I read another of these Alice short stories a few months ago but I can’t remember the name or author. :/ ETA: Okay, I figured it out, but unfortunately it’s not an online freebie. “Tough Alice” is a story in Jane Yolen’s The Emerald Circus short story collection. It does feature a battle with the Jabberwock, so you should totally find it!

           Dreams , figments of the wondrous mind, what things can it create...A little girl named Alice, 7 with her big sister a few years older, sitting on the banks of the gentle river Thames, on a calm , warm sunny day, in 1862 how delightful , still she is bored watching her sibling read a book, not paying any attention to her, with no pictures, imagine that... getting sleepy...Out of nowhere a nervous White Rabbit dashes by Alice, no big deal even though it has clothes on, not thinking it peculiar when the animal speaks, looking at a watch, and declares he will be late to an important party. Intrigued the child follows the rapid rabbit down a large hole, a long tunnel , soon finding a precipice, then falling and falling, the never ending drop continues as the frightened girl starts to believe, maybe, quite possible , arrive finally on the other side of the world, welcome Australia. Nevertheless landing safely in a pile of leaves, unhurt Alice in a strange hall sees a bottle that says drink me. She the brave girl does, being much too big, for this land, needing to get out, to the beautiful place outside that Alice views, through the door, too small for her and shrinks... this will not be the last time either, her size will vary in future adventures in this magical tale. Meeting a plethora of mad characters, as one of them matter of fact boasts we&apos;re all mad here. The Cheshire Cat with his always grinning smile as he fades away and reappears ...the Queen of Hearts the annoyed ruler frequently shouts and proclaims, &quot;Off with their heads&quot;, and her curiouser and curiouser croquet match...with real animals for equipment, the Mad Hatter and his perpetual tea party with the March Hare who enjoys puzzling Alice. The mellow Caterpillar likes sitting on top of a mushroom smoking leisurely and showing scorn for the little girl&apos;s silly questions, the Mock Turtle who head looks like a cow and is sad, the ugly Duchess sneezing because her maid&apos;s over use of pepper, other weird souls in this enchanting book appear. If you are a type of person who relishes the road less traveled, this will be up your alley. A classic children&apos;s fable that will always be a favorite, having sold more than 100 million copies, and adults can be entrapped also, and benefit by the amusing satire of their foibles, which everyone has.That is being human ...

      I just read Marissa Meyer&apos;s Heartless which is a prequel to Alice, telling the story of the Queen of Hearts. I found it a very fun read for this familiar with the Alice stories.

           “Once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.”If I ever had to choose to be another literary person than my beloved soulmate Don Quixote, it would have to be Alice in Wonderland. Why would I need to be another character than the one and only Don? Well, it is good to have a backup if you are asked to come to a masquerade as a favourite book character (a not completely unlikely risk and side effect of my profession), and you realise that your blonde hair and the emphasis on blue dresses in your wardrobe makes that a much more natural choice than the Medieval male dresscode of La Mancha.On the other hand, Alice is a perfect complement to the Don in many ways. While he sets out to give the ordinary world some magic, she dives into Wonderland to make it sparkle with her common sense approach to madness. A perfect pair, those two characters. In times like these, they are needed more than ever, to fight the windmills or Jabberwockys of modern craziness. As coffee is a means of survival to me, and I like the idea of drinking it out of a mug featuring an illustration of a famous tea party - as nonsensical as most, but more fun - I once went to London and bought myself a Mad Hatter mug, the handle nicely formed like one of those keys Alice had such trouble with. The quote on the back of the mug has helped me (along with the caffeine and a sense of humour as dark as my no-milk-and-no-sugar coffee) survive many a lesson with teenagers:&quot;If you knew Time as well as I do,’ said the Hatter, ‘you wouldn’t talk about wasting it.&quot;I know for a fact that this book can be reread as many times as needed to figure out your own identity and level of madness, without any waste of time whatsoever:“Who am I then? Tell me that first, and then, if I like being that person, I&apos;ll come up; if not, I&apos;ll stay down here till I&apos;m someone else.”I can almost give the same promise that Milo got in The Phantom Tollbooth:&quot;RESULTS ARE NOT GUARANTEED, BUT IF NOT PERFECTLY SATISFIED, YOUR WASTED TIME WILL BE REFUNDED.&quot;
         
        
      Alice and Quijote... what would Sancho say? would he be jealous?
    
  
        
      Alice and Quixote make for a fitting pair. But a pairing between Sancho and the Hatter... ah, the conversations they would have. Wonderland would be shaken. Tis a fun review ye ave here.

After all, Alice is in the Middle of Fiokalician... But that does not necessarily means she knows where that is. A wondrous mix-up.

      And when you read the original, Alice&apos;s version is so naughtyHow doth the little busy beeImprove each shining hour,And gather honey all the dayFrom every opening flower!How skilfully she builds her cell!How neat she spreads the wax!And labors hard to store it wellWith the sweet food she makes.In works of labor or of skill,I would be busy too;For Satan finds some mischief stillFor idle hands to do.In books, or work, or healthful play,Let my first years be passed,That I may give for every daySome good account at last.It is really such a good parody!

  Curiouser and curiouser edition!
This is the annotated edition, collecting both novels in the Alice book series: “Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland” and “Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice found There”.
  WE’RE ALL MAD HERE

  Begin at the beginning…
This was technically a re-reading since I’ve already read both novels previously, the key difference here was that this is an “annotated” edition, which includes a comprehensive section, at the end of each chapter, with tons of notes revealing “behind-the-scenes” detailing moments in the life of Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (aka Lewis Carroll), the “real” meaning of scenes, the “real” inspirations for several of the characters in both novels, historic meaning (in the Victorian England) of casual expressions that got outdated nowadays, studies in the metrics of the poems included in the novels, etc…
  I don’t think…

  Then you shouldn’t talk…
It was a curiouser and curiouser reading experience since this was my first “annotated edition” of any book, and I believe that if you want to engage into this sort of books, it’s advisable having read the regular version of the novel first, since reading all those annotations after each chapter, it’s a kinda of “braking” effect, since depending the chapter, you’ll invest almost the same time reading the explanations than the chapter itself, so you lose a great deal of the rhythm of your reading, therefore, if you haven’t read the story before, you may not enjoying as much as it was supposed to be.
  It’s a poor sort of memory that only works backwards.
Of course, almost all the information was made by scholars in the Lewis Carroll’s works, doing assumptions and best guesses, since the author was already gone when this annotated edition began to be conceived. Therefore, it’s a priceless access to get a better understanding of the novels at the era when they were published, BUT…
  …sometimes I’ve believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.
…you can’t fully take without a doubt the exposed explanations, since you can’t ask the author anymore to validate if their interpretations are truly accurate. So, as many things in life, it’s up to you if you wish to believe them.
  I can’t go back to yesterday because I was a different person then.
And as those scholars mentioned at some momento of the annotations, that sometimes we are so obssessed to find a secret meaning behind any single quote, any single character, any single scene, etc… and while it’s evident that some quotes, characters and scenes have indeed a double significance, some of them are merely things needed to keep flowing the narrative, as simply as that, without any conspiration or secret plot,…
  I’m not strange, weird, off, nor crazy, my reality is just different from yours.
…so don’t get too deep into the annotations section and simply enjoy this wonderfully mad tale about a little girl who fell down into a rabbit’s hole and she kept finding curiouser and curiouser things, even through the looking-glass.
  …and go on till you come to the end: then stop.

         
        
      I really want to read this one! Wrote an essay about Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland in university (about the language games etc) and used some pieces of this book (although I agree with you; lots of sentences actually have more to them then than meets the eye, but’s lot is also just to continue a nice and nonsensical story). Love the review
    
  
        
      I agree about annotations taking us out of the story, but also enriching the reading experience. I think they&apos;re much more enjoyable during a reread. Wonderful review!

           Read both as a child, and again as an adult. Loved and appreciated it then; love and appreciate it now. A book everyone should read at least once, and one that I hope children are still reading today.
         
        
      I was about to write my review and then I read yours. Ditto! I A book to be loved and enjoyed. Regardless of age. Timeless
    
  
        
      I am unfortunate soul who did not appreciate books when he was a child. I learn to enjoy books after I met my wife. so for this particular title(s), I did not even knew it was a book until now. so I will look for it and give it a try, for sure. I&apos;m currently reading star trek titan and redwall.
    
  
        
      Like you I hope children today are introduced to the classics. I have little hope as I see very little evidence that they are. If not for me, my grandchildren wouldn&apos;t know who Raggedy Ann is nor would they know Peter Rabbit. Don&apos;t get me started on mythology.

           Then Alice saw a large wall in the middle distance. Someone was sitting on the top of it. When Alice had come within a few yards of it, she saw that the thing sitting on the wall had eyes and a nose and mouth and a large pile of golden hair; and when she had come very close, she saw clearly that it was TRUMPTY DUMPTY himself. &quot;It must be him because that’s what is written on his baseball cap,&quot; she said to herself. He was already speaking to her. “They said I wouldn’t build the wall and I built the wall. They were wrong because they weren’t right. Really really really great wall.”“I’m sure it is,” said Alice. “What is it for?”“Believe me, this is the greatest wall there ever was,”“I’m sure it is,” said Alice, “but please, what is it for?”“The people, there were people, who said the wall would never be built, they were not smart people, as you see, the wall is right here, it is extremely extremely here, believe me.”“Yes, I do see that it is, but please,” said Alice, getting rather impatient, “what is it for?”“Those people, there were so many many of them, they said the wall was never ever ever going to be built, that’s what they said, you can check that, it’s there in the record. They were really really not smart those people. Everyone here can see that this is a great great day. That is what people are telling me. ”“But –&quot; started Alice.“We are making Wonderland great again. Really really great. Dozens, hundreds of people, have said that there would be no wall. No wall at all. They said it would never never never happen. You can’t find those people any more because they are on the other side of the wall. Oh yes, there is another side of the wall. Really really other side. Can you hear them?”Trumpty put his hand to his ear, exaggeratedly listening. Alice listened hard too for a moment but could not hear a sound, except for Trumpty talking continually. She had by now given up trying to ask Trumpty Dumpty anything at all. It was as if he did not know what a conversation was.“It’s going to be amazing, really amazing. You will see Wonderland great again. So great.”*Sorry about that..... I really just wanted to flag up that this Definitive 150th Anniversary edition by Martin Gardner is exquisite and replaces all previous editions. So if you have a birthday coming up, you could ask for this! And if you get it you&apos;ll have a smile that will take a really really great long time to fade away. Believe me. 
         
        
      Reading this dialog in the same voice and cadence as the character&apos;s namesake got a giggle outta me. Well done.
    
  
        
      It bothers me that we&apos;re going to have to put up with Trump impersonators long after the man himself is dead
    
  
        
      I love your reviews, Paul. 😃😆
    
  
        
      thanks everybody!
    
  
      &quot;We will throw all our refuse over it and again be clean. No more landfills. No more acrid burnings. Just whoop and over the wall it goes.&quot;&quot;Won&apos;t they throw it back?&quot;&quot;Who?&quot;&quot;The people on the other side.&quot;&quot;There are no people on the other side; just slovenly aliens who like to live in trash.&quot;&quot;God bless Murica and Trumpty Dumpty, our Garbageman in Chief.&quot;
    
  
        
      That big smile you promise - a Cheshire cat grin, perhaps?
    
  
        
      i think so!
    
  
        
      I still have an edition from. . the seventies? I will find this, thanks!

           This is a weird one. The more I read the more I&apos;m okay with the weirdness. Does that say something about me? I thought at first I wouldn&apos;t read it to my kids because it&apos;s too strange, but I&apos;m thinking now I might. They just might like it. We&apos;ll see how it ends. Am I lame that I&apos;ve never read this before? Okay, done with them both. Alice in Wonderland was okay. Still weird. Weird and I didn&apos;t understand it. Through the Looking Glass took weird to a whole new level. A bad level. The whole time I was reading it I was thinking, &quot;Is Carroll on crack? This makes no sense.&quot; And then I thought maybe I needed to be on crack to understand it. I&apos;ve had crazy dreams sort of like this, all disjointed and random and all, but that doesn&apos;t mean I want to read a book about psycho dreams. And what&apos;s up with shaking the poor kitten all the time? I might read Wonderland to the kids. I won&apos;t read Through the Looking Glass.And does anyone really know what this all means? Because if it&apos;s &quot;just for fun&quot;, it wasn&apos;t.
         
        
      If you truly wish to know and understand then I would suggest reading Martin Gardner&apos;s &apos;The Annotated Alice&apos; as he explains the jokes, nonsense, etc. that is throughout both stories. Much of this are items that were popular and commonly known in the Victorian era so it can be a little confusing to the modern reader. You may still end up not enjoying the book as others do, but it will give you some insight to the story.
    
  
        
      I totally agree! I couldn&apos;t understand what Looking glass was all about! As much as I thought that &apos;wonderland&apos; was good &apos;looking glass&apos; was a bit too much.
    
  
        
      I know just what you mean. It&apos;s...weird. I&apos;m surprised that this book was so popular a long time ago. Did it not like...scare them!? Haha, it&apos;s not really bad or anything, it&apos;s just psychedelic... if that makes any sense.
    
  
      the book had no purpose it was just random stuff put in a book!!!!i cant believe it i mean i read older books and there not as confusing as this one
    
  
        
      Alice&apos;s Adventures in Wonderland is a great book, but I agree with you entirely about Through the Looking Glass. It is a horrible book. It doesn&apos;t seem like the same author wrote it. Lewis Carroll must have been really pressed for cash at the time to turn up something so awful.
    
  
        
      My version (Penguin Books, Edited with notes by Hugh Haughton) of both Alice&apos;s Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass had very helpful notes at the end of the books. Referring to the footnotes throughout both books really helped me to understand the true meaning behind the words and the many allusions that Carroll incorporated within both works. I truly enjoyed both AAIW and TLG, and I feel much of my enjoyment is owed to the help the footnotes gave me.
    
  
        
      I have grown up listening to Alice in Wonder and Through the Looking glass and the more I listen the more I understand. So I have one bit of wisdom for the confused reader. You are supposed to be confused and bewildered and befuddled! The main character herself, is confused and bewildered and befuddled. This is a children&apos;s book, written by a man who had not lost sight of the fantasy of childhood. Children live in a world where everything is confusing. Alice&apos;s dreams are filled with bits and pieces of the grownup world that she doesn&apos;t understand. Reading these books really makes me feel like a little kid.Oh, one last thing, little kids love these books because they are ridiculous and don&apos;t talk down to them like alot of kids books do. Happy reading!!
    
  
        
      I like your point of view, Christa. :)
    
  
        
      Ironically enough, there&apos;s no real evidence that Carroll did any hardcore drugs like crack and LSD wasn&apos;t even invented during his time. I think the man was a genius but a bit insane. Funny how all unquestionable geniuses are considered socially incompetent.
    
  
      No crack... but he drank mushroom tea... I love this book!
    
  
        
      Hahaha you dudes. Brilliant book.
    
  
        
      hhhhhhhh despite the fact i loved both books and gave them five stars ,i loved ur review, i felt the same while reading it&quot; got used to weirdness&quot; but i enjoyed it though
    
  
        
      well i think thats the beauty of &quot;through the looking glass&quot;
    
  
        
      Though Alice&apos;s Adventures in Wonderland may seem nonsensical, Lewis Carroll was actually a logician and employs formal logic throughout the novel. Much of the novel was meant to teach various logical fallacies and how valid arguments can be unsound and so on. Here are a few specific examples, but there are many more.
    
  
        
      Agree with you. Classics or not, I can&apos;t stand either of these books and never could.
    
  
        
      It&apos;s really sad when people don&apos;t get imagination and whimsy
    
  
        
      It&apos;s because his storytelling is similar to a kids imagination . I just finished it and I found the weirdness very familiar , it reminds me of my childhood dreams
    
  
        
      The book is meant for it to be weird. It is a reflection on childhood, on what is real and what is not. As for shaking kittens, well it&apos;s a 7 and a half. Cut her some slack, and tell your kids that it&apos;s wrong, and they can enjoy the nonsense.
    
  
        
      Err... sorry. 7 and half year old...

           “But I don&apos;t want to go among mad people,&quot; Alice remarked.&quot;Oh, you can’t help that,&quot; said the Cat: &quot;we&apos;re all mad here. I&apos;m mad. You&apos;re mad.&quot;&quot;How do you know I&apos;m mad?&quot; said Alice.&quot;You must be,&quot; said the Cat, &quot;or you wouldn&apos;t have come here.”150 years ago, Charles Lutwidge Dodgson welcomed a new Dean to Christ Church College, Oxford, along with his family, including the three daughters, Lorina, Edith and Alice. Charles had been writing prose and poetry since a very young age, but it was young Alice Liddell who encouraged him to write down the stories he had made up for her and her sisters, thus Alice&apos;s Adventures in Wonderland was published and has since been a stalwart in children&apos;s reading treasuries.Charles, or more famously known by his alias Lewis Carroll, was an extraordinary man, graduating from Oxford with a first in Mathematics and going on to study and teach at Oxford, where he remained until his death in 1898. Not only did he write, but he was an early pioneer of photography and also painted. He predominantly wrote short stories and poems, but Alice&apos;s Adventures in Wonderland was a longer version of his unique writing style, and was published in 1865 to great acclaim. He became famous almost over night and wrote the sequel Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There, though this particular story seemed much darker than the much-loved Wonderland, most probably caused by the depression he felt after the death of his father in 1871. Sylvie and Bruno, a tale of fairy siblings is a lesser known story from Carroll in 1895 and did not fair as well as Alice ever did though it remains in print as a testimony to the wonderful writer Lewis Carroll was.Lewis Carroll&apos;s writing is often described as surreal and nonsensical, a lot of his words are made up, but are used in today&apos;s language-think specifically of the poem Jabberwocky-and he has had almost as much impact on the way we use language as Shakespeare ever did. The word &apos;chortle&apos; is used today as commonly as if it truly were a real word for laughing:`Twas brillig, and the slithy toves Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:All mimsy were the borogoves, And the mome raths outgrabe.&quot;Beware the Jabberwock, my son! The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun The frumious Bandersnatch!&quot;[...]&quot;And, has thou slain the Jabberwock? Come to my arms, my beamish boy!O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!&apos; He chortled in his joy.In my most recent re-read of Alice, I decided I would read aloud the poetry within the book. There is a lot more poetry in it than I originally remembered, all of which is told to Alice by the various characters she meets. The made-up Carrollian words sound both strange and familiar on the tongue and one can find a genuine lilting rhythm to the entire book when experienced out loud with sound.Beneath the surface, the story can be seen as quite dark, particularly the latter story Through the Looking-Glass. Whilst both retain the whimsical, surreal nature of another world, Looking-Glass has more of a sinister overtone, with more things going wrong for Alice and many more characters being unkind to one another. It also showed another side to Alice herself, as she had grown out of the rabbit hole and crying her way out of situations and instead wished more than anything to be a Queen. Her previous adventure with the Queen must have sparked this desire, though Alice had shown nothing but disdain for the Queen of Wonderland who wanted to chop everyone&apos;s head off at any given moment.I found myself enjoying the latter book to the former: I cannot place my finger on the reason why, however. If nothing else, it is probably the more grown-up version of Alice I prefer, though in reality she is still just a child. Her experiences in her first Wonderland adventure seemed to have impacted her fervently, as she navigated the Looking-Glass Wonderland exceedingly well, often outsmarting those who were native to it.The two books-often just collated in to one large one known as Alice in Wonderland-are actually all I&apos;ve ever read of Lewis Carroll&apos;s works, though I am intrigued by his other works, particularly his poetry. The surreal, nonsense nature of the poetry in Alice is unique to Carroll and I&apos;d be curious to see if it carries over in to his other works. Have you ever read his other works?There is some controversy surrounded Lewis Carroll, mostly brought up in biographies of him, particularly regarding his friendliness with young girls such as the Liddell children, but I shan&apos;t be commenting on that here. Instead we shall concentrate on the great piece of literature he left behind, which he wrote whilst he was both disappointed and unhappy with his job of teaching at Oxford (despite remaining there until his death) and saddened by the loss of his mother early on in his life and by his father after Alice&apos;s Adventures in Wonderland was published. It is too much to wonder whether the reputation of such an absorbing, wonderful book would be tarnished if his biographers ever learnt the exact truth of his nature and the absurdities of accusations are most likely driven by the era they find themselves in.There are many events taking place in 2015 to celebrate the 150th anniversary of this wonderful, wondrous, wandering book all over the globe. Royal Mail are producing celebratory collection stamps in honour of the landmark and who can forget the wonderful (if rather libertarian) Disney film? The best thing you can do is to read and re-read this book an enjoy it for what it is: a beautifully written, surreal and nonsense book that has captivated the imaginations of children and adults alike.[On the night I re-read Alice&apos;s Adventures in Wonderland, the moon decided to show me his best Cheshire Cat smile in celebration of the 150th Anniversary of the book.]Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Pinterest | Shop | Etsy
         
        
      Wonderful review! Made me want to reread Alice, and read this one too!!

Arguably literature&apos;s greatest study of shallowness, vanity, casual cruelty and hedonistic selfishness, Wilde lays it down here with ABSOLUTE PERFECTION!! This was my first experience in reading Oscar Wilde and the man’s gift for prose and dialogue is magical. This story read somewhat like a dark, corrupted Jane Austen in that the writing was snappy and pleasant on the ear, but the feeling it left you with was one of hopelessness and despair. The level of cynicism and societal disregard that Wilde’s characters display towards humanity is simply staggering. Despite the dark (or more likely because of it) this is one of the most engaging, compelling and lyrical pieces of literature I have read. The quality of the prose is nothing short masterful. I assume most people know the basic outline of the plot, but I will give you a few sentences on it. The three main characters are Basil Hallward, Lord Henry Wotton and Dorian Gray. Basil Hallward is an artist who after painting a picture of Dorian Gray becomes obsessed with him because of his beauty (the homosexual vs. art object love Basil feels towards Dorian are left vague, likely because of the time it was written). Dorian then meets a friend Basil’s, Lord Henry, and becomes enthralled with Lord Henry’s world view, which is a form of extreme hedonism that posits the only worthwhile life is one spent pursuing beauty and satisfaction for the senses.
  The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it. Resist it, and your soul grows sick with longing for the things it has forbidden to itself, with desire for what its monstrous laws have made monstrous and unlawful.
 Well at one point, Dorian utters the famous words quoted at the beginning of my review and the “Faustian” bargain is struck. While this story is often mentioned among the classics of the Horror genre (which I do have a problem with) this is much more a study of the human monster than it is some boogeyman. My favorite parts of the story were the extensive dialogues between the characters, usually Dorian and Lord Henry. They were wonderfully perverse and display a level of casual cruelty and vileness towards humanity that make it hard to breathe while reading. Oh, and Lord Henry reserves particular offense for the female of the species, to wit: 
  My dear boy, no woman is a genius. Women are a decorative sex. They never have anything to say, but they say it charmingly. Women represent the triumph of matter over mind, just as men represent the triumph of mind over morals.
. 
  
YES folks...he absolutely did. One of the most intriguing quotes I have seen from Oscar Wilde regarding this book is his comparison of himself to the three main characters. He said that he wrote the three main characters as reflections of himself. Wilde said, “Basil Hallward is what I think I am: Lord Henry is what the world thinks me: Dorian is what I would like to be—in other ages, perhaps.”I was somewhat floored by this as I found Dorian to be a truly stark representation of evil and could not see how Wilde could find an idealized form within the character. When I say evil, I don&apos;t mean just misguided or weak-minded, someone bamboozled by the clever lectures of Lord Henry. I found Gray to be selfish, vain, inhumanly callous and sadistically cruel. I intend to try and learn more about Wilde’s outlook on this character as it truly escapes me.Regardless, this is a towering piece of literature. Beautifully written and filled with memorable characters and a deeply moving story. A novel deserving of its status as a classic of English Literature. 5.0 stars. HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!!!!P.S. For of audiobooks. I listened to the audio version of this read by Michael Page who has become one of my favorite narrators. His performance here was amazing. 
         
        
      I&apos;ve always had this book on my radar, I should really read it already. Thanks.
    
  
        
      Hi Stephen, we agree on this. I to thought Dorian was THE villain of the piece. So many zero in on Lord Henry, yet from the very first, even before his &quot;deal&quot; he&apos;s perfectly willing to manipulate Basil. From Dorian&apos;s point of view the world circles him, he seems to me possibly to be even a sociopath. His &quot;repentances&quot; (multiple) are much like the thief who&apos;s not sorry he stole, but is very sorry he got caught. The story also made me curious about Wilde himself.

Of course, Lord Henry is pretty bad despicable too but he comes across as kind of a moral rabble-rouser who is more there to explain Dorian&apos;s actions to the reader (since Dorian has no ability to self analyze) then to CAUSE them. It certainly was a fascinating read.
    
  
        
      Me to. Over the length of the book I came to think of Lord Henry as one of those who talks a lot just to hear himself, that he was being &quot;outrageous&quot; for effect. And I&apos;ve come to think that Wilde was a bit like that. In spite of his reputation as a &quot;libertine&quot; (in the vernacular of the day), the book comes out, in the end, to be very &quot;traditional morality&quot; conscious.
    
  
        
      This was my first exposure to Oscar Wilde, and I find I am very captivated with his writing. I went on to read The Canterville Ghost and love that one as well.
    
  
        
      I&apos;ve just read Constance The Tragic and Scandalous Life of Mrs. Oscar Wilde and so many of Wilde&apos;s attitudes are expressed in the fiction of Dorian Gray. It seems to me now less pure fiction than a way to tell the world what he thought of it.

I was really taken aback that Wilde would see Dorian Gray as his idealized form, but your comment seems to support exactly that.

      &quot;Arguably literature&apos;s greatest study of shallowness, vanity, casual cruelty and hedonistic selfishness...&quot;You can only write about what you know. Wilde&apos;s biography would treat him at times no better, and I&apos;m not sure that Wilde at his worst isn&apos;t worse than Dorian. Wilde is one of the great tragedies of humanity - nearly unsurpassed gifts and talent and nearly completely wasted life.I think the attraction of Dorian to Wilde is that Wilde sees Dorian as braver than himself and more true to his self (more perfectly himself) than Wilde is. I think it would be a mistake to think that everyone creates the same heroes. You are right to find Dorian a truly stark representation of evil; what however makes you think a stark representation of evil is unattractive to everyone?

His last five years consisted of two years in prison and three years in ill health.I don&apos;t know whether it is accurate to say that the 41 years before then (or even those years) were &quot;nearly completely wasted&quot;.At some point, he made the following self-assessment:“I put all my genius into my life; I put only my talent into my works.”This might have been more witty than true, again I don&apos;t know.There have been a number of biographies.There is an interesting comparison of two here:http://www.123helpme.com/view.asp?id=...

      Wow! I was just over in Will&apos;s review thread for The Death of the Liberal Class, after you liked his review. Quite the seminar on civics, as we once called it. The untrammeled rise of corporate power nauseates me. To hear corporate execs whine about how their profits are down because of taxation makes me want to vomit. Listen a-hole, your profits aren&apos;t like your penis, you aren&apos;t the only one who decides what to do with &apos;em.Taxes are like greens fees. The USA is like Pebble Beach. You show up there and expect to play a fast 9 holes without a) buying a membership and 2) paying your dues, whaddaya think the course runners will do to you? Hint: The security guard and the black ball are involved.*fumes*Oh, yeah, I was so ticked I forgot to say &quot;got yer back, kid&quot; and good luck on the whole adolescence thing. I send cyberhugs. Your ego will need them.

      An excellent review!!! I was going to write a review of this book but as I see &apos;You have said it all.&apos; Great Review
    
  
        
      I read this book about fifteen years ago and reading your review has made me want to pick it up again - Thank you for reminding me of the joys of reading Oscar Wilde!
    
  
        
      I enjoyed your review, but to compare Oscar Wilde&apos;s prose to that of Jane Austen is insulting to Wilde.
    
  
        
      Oh, you HAVE to read The Importance of Being Ernest. It&apos;s a play, so quite a bit shorter, and my favourite of Wilde&apos;s works.
    
  
        
      His plays are very good. A Woman of No Importance is great
    
  
        
      Until Dorian Gray II was birthed on the day Rush Limbaugh entered the world. Shallowness, vanity, cruelty and hedonistic selfishness took up a new definition when Rush Limbaugh was born.
    
  
        
      Thank you for your reviews. I&apos;m truly enthralled by this novel but it is also hard to express my feelings toward it. I also think Dorian is selfish, self-centered and shallow. All he can do is focus on his own feelings and to fine the highest satisfaction of the senses. But are we all somehow similar? Dorian is just the most extreme version of a person who utterly enjoys individualism and aestheticism. After the first half of the book, he becomes much more cruel, it is because he does not have to suffer for what he has done. If each of us does not have to be responsible for what we do, do we act like him (to some extent)? Wilde&apos;s writing reveals the dark side of a normal person. I&apos;m only 23 by the way, thus I&apos;m sure I do not know much about life. I was also surprised about what Oscar thought about himself in comparison with the three characters. I always hope/believe that he is Basil :)

           ** spoiler alert **
           This book reminded me why I hate classics.Like Frankenstein, it starts out with a great premise: what if a portrait bore the brunt of age and sin, while the person remained in the flush of youth? How would that person feel as they watched a constant reminder of their true nature develop? And like Frankenstein, it gets completely bogged down in uninteresting details and takes forever to get to the interesting bits. Seriously, in a 230-page novel, the portrait doesn&apos;t even start to change until 100 pages in. And it&apos;s so damn flowery. Every time Lord Harry starts talking (and believe me, he likes to talk) he&apos;s so witty. Witty witty witty. Ahahaha, you&apos;re soooooooo worldly wise and charming. And entirely cynical! You just have a quip for everything, don&apos;t you? Look, reader, look. See Harry. See Harry corrupt Dorian. Corrupt, Harry, corrupt! I actually ended up skimming most of the book. I really thought about stopping, but I hoped it would redeem itself by the end. It didn&apos;t. I should have just skipped to the last page. So to save you, dear reader, the same pain I went through, is the summary of Dorian Gray (spoilers, of course):Dorian semi-consciously makes Faustian bargain to transfer all his sins and signs of age to his portrait. He sins and feels guilty about it, but keeps doing it anyway. He finally decides to get ride of the portrait/evidence and stabs the painting. Surprise, it breaks the spell, and he is left ugly, old and dead while his portrait returns to its original form. The end. You can thank me later. UPDATE 9/3/12: Since this review is still around and kicking four years later, I thought I might point like-minded individuals to a new parody of classic literature to the tune of Call Me Maybe: Call Me Ishmael! 
         
        
      Amen! I won&apos;t thank you later, I&apos;ll thank you now.
    
  
      As for me I will thank you never, because your review does not give the book justice, I think that you are mixing up the quality of the book with the quality of your ability to like good literature.
    
  
        
      I can&apos;t understand how anybody with an 8th grade reading level or higher can call this book uninteresting. I&apos;ve read it twice and loved it both times.
    
  
        
      Well, at least I&apos;m not the only person who thought Dorian Gray is too chatty. Oscar Wilde commented, &quot;I am afraid it is rather like my own life--all conversation and no action.&quot;
    
  
        
      I think you are just another of those people who desperately seek action in a book. I think this is when I have to remind you that we are not talking about some hollywood movie, but one of the greatest works of literature. So if you think the book is too heavy for you, go read something easy like &quot;twilight&quot;.

It was genius!
    
  
        
      For whatever reason, people get really agitated about this review in particular and imply that my literary judgement is, shall we say, non-existent. You&apos;ll also note that no one has refuted my statements other than saying it&apos;s a &quot;classic.&quot; Just as a quick review, ad hominem attacks are logical fallacies, so please insult my ideas, not me. But hey, maybe it IS me. Maybe the fact that I&apos;ve read (and yes, enjoyed) classics ranging from Don Quixote to Lolita to 2666 (which is very good, btw, but not great) has left me incapable of appreciating literature. So let&apos;s check in with what a professional critic has to say about Wilde. Meet Daniel Mendelsohn, considered one of the greatest living critics and author of &quot;How Beautiful It Is and How Easily It Can Be Broken&quot; (an excellent book that will make you love essays, of all things). From &quot;The Two Oscar Wildes:&quot; ...&quot;It was evident that even &apos;Dorian Gray&apos;... hadn&apos;t been the ideal vehicle for his gifts; Wilde himself knew perfectly well he wasn&apos;t really a novelist. ... His true metier, as the course of his career would soon demonstrate, was dialogue--real dialogue, rather than the rococo verses he&apos;d put in the mouths of his early characters. It&apos;s the voice of Wilde the brilliant talker...that you hear in the plays.&quot; Or for a different perspective, let&apos;s hear from Robert McKee, recognized as one of the best screenwriting teachers around. Surely he might have some insight on the unique advantages novels and plays have in comparison to movies? &quot;A great play is almost pure dialogue, perhaps 80 percent is for the ear, only 20 percent for the eye... What&apos;s more, the playwright has a license screenwriters do not--he may write dialogue in a way no human being has ever spoken... The theater&apos;s power to dramatize inner conflict through unspoken subtext is ample but, compared to the novel, limited.&quot;Aha! So now we get to the crux of the problem with &quot;Dorian Gray:&quot; it is, in fact, a play masquerading as a novel. If I were to go back and edit out all the witty, witty dialogue, how much of the novel would remain? (Hint: about the same as the summary in my original review). The idea behind &quot;Dorian Gray&quot; is a brilliant idea, but a novel that is 80% dialogue does not a novel make. A better novelist would have made this story a true classic. Perhaps the best part of &quot;Dorian Gray&quot; was that it made Wilde realize that he was better (indeed, sublimely) suited to other mediums. 
    
  
        
      You are obviously as hairy as you are daft!!! This book and author are key to intelligence and observance! This book is as pertinent today as it was almost a century ago!!! Only a true neanderthal would put this piece of marvelousness down!!!!
    
  
        
      ok, so you think that showing us the views of those critics will justify your review? that is pathetic. saying what others have said only shows that you do not have much to say.and by the way, when critisising someone&apos;s views on literature, ad hominem attacks are necessary and should be expected. your ideas ARE you.
    
  
        
      You know, it&apos;s a shame that people in this day and age are insulting Neanderthals&apos; intelligence when Geico has done so much to combat this persistent prejudice. At least Wec8469&apos;s comments get points for being ridiculous to the point of amusing. But ad hominem attacks being necessary? You, sir, are an idiot. Hey, see how I did that? I changed the topic! We just went from discussing whether ad hominem attacks are necessary to questioning your mental condition. You might be an idiot. You might not. It doesn&apos;t have anything to do with the truth of your claim. Brilliant people sometimes have dumb ideas. A broken watch is right twice a day. Your ideas AREN&apos;T you and can be criticized separately. I&apos;ve stated my ideas several times now: Dorian Gray&apos;s concept is great. The execution leaves a lot to be desired. If you disagree, oh brilliant defenders of classic literature, please, do enlighten me. But guess what? Calling me names is probably not going to make me change my mind. How about pointing out that perhaps Lord Harry&apos;s verbosity is essential to the novel&apos;s theme in that language can also obscure a character&apos;s inner ugliness? That argument&apos;s a freebie. Come up with some others and maybe we can have an intelligent debate. Otherwise, I&apos;m gonna assume you&apos;re insulting me because you can&apos;t prove my ideas wrong.Finally, William, when criticizing someone&apos;s views on literature, make sure you spell &quot;criticizing&quot; right (though I would have also accepted &quot;criticising&quot;). 
    
  
        
      Okay, this lack of debate of Dorian Gray&apos;s literary merits has gone on long enough. If you&apos;ve got a valid comment to make regarding the novel, go ahead. Otherwise, I&apos;m deleting them.

      One that sticks to a critique of the novel. &quot;Dorian Gray deserves to be a classic because it challenged social mores when it was published&quot; is a good start. &quot;Wilde&apos;s excessive dialogue is better suited to a play and weakens the work as a novel&quot; is another. &quot;You probably don&apos;t even know how to read&quot; is not. If others are convinced Dorian Gray is a great novel, I invite them to explain why, so long as they don&apos;t resort to &quot;because it&apos;s classic literature.&quot;

      If I read another line of Lord Henry&apos;s idiotic banter, I am going to find a way to go back in time, locate Oscar Wilde, and bludgeon him.
    
  
        
      The novel is brilliant, and what you failed to recognize was its merit in terms of characterization, and its revelation of the author&apos;s life. The reason this could not have been a play is because there is only one character in it: Oscar Wilde himself. When I read the novel, just within the first chapter or so I was struck with the realization that this was Wilde exploring his own psyche and simultaneously divulging his innermost dreams and fears.In addition to being an exploration of one of the most fascinating authors in history, the language is still quite beautiful. Not only that, but it raises very interesting moral questions.Is it the best novel ever written? Of course not. But it is rather good. In the author&apos;s defense and as you have pointed out, Wilde is primarily a playwright, and was working far outside of his comfort zone by writing a novel. I must say that satirical playwright Wilde&apos;s novel is a damn sight better than satirical novelist Twain&apos;s play, which is utterly unreadable.
    
  
        
      I was about half way though when I read your review. I was a little pissed about you breaking the ending for me and even though I could def see where you were coming from I continued to read the book. I finished it, and yes I&apos;m disappointed :-(
    
  
      I highly recommend the illustrated edition!
    
  
        
      I would just like to know why intelligent people cannot value an individual&apos;s opinion and instead leave scathing comments that question a person&apos;s intellect? Not everyone has the same taste in classics. This one definitely is very dry compared to many others. Not bad, but certainly not life-changing.
    
  
        
      You know Kenna, I would love to know the same thing. I am fairly amused by how people keep coming back to this particular review, though. Oh, and for all those who do actually love this book because it is the greatest single work of literature ever bestowed on mankind, etc. etc., you should be aware that the movie is coming out in September. You&apos;re welcome. 
    
  
        
      Also, Ana, I went and added a little spoilers note right before the full summary.Ana wrote: &quot;I was about half way though when I read your review.

      Somewhat hypocritical of you to ask readers not to challenge your review with personal attacks when your review itself is, as I read it, &quot;I don&apos;t like Dorian Gray because it was too chatty, but I skimmed it.&quot; Might I ask, why did you even bother writing the review if you just skimmed the book? Oscar Wilde didn&apos;t write this book to be skimmed. Oscar Wilde was an aesthete. His book reflects the entire aesthetic movement and himself with it. Inside and between nearly every line in this book there not only witticisms but meanings for why they were important, or what Wilde wished the reader to see in them, or how they strengthened the plot itself. Depending on your edition, these instances are sometimes marked in footnotes or brought up in the appendix. Sometimes it just takes a little patience to find the parallel later in the story, or earlier on the second read....and sometimes--rarely, I should say--they&apos;re just pointless, snarky quips of Brit humour :PI agree that the book takes patience and you, yourself, have recognized you did not give it that patience. It could be Wilde&apos;s fault as a writer that his book could not keep your interest in a different age, or it could be your fault for not approaching it in the right way to enjoy this book in the way millions of students, asthetes, philosophers, theists, casual readers, etc. have in the past.
    
  
        
      I suppose this is the review to respond to when a fan of Dorian Gray see&apos;s such a review. I think many people are responding to this review and keep coming back is because it highlights the problem with reviews. First as Doug pointed out one can not review a book by skimming it, your review would do better in the cliff notes section of Dorian Gray.Second, there is a trap in holding Faust as the pinnacle and holding all other like pieces in contempt. The soul is a universal topic not an idea Goethe pulled out of his own head. You do not explicitly praise Faust over Gray but your citation of Gray making a Faustian bargain implicates it.Lastly, the flowery wit is best understood then skimmed through. If the wit bothers you then there must be a reason why and that would be understandable but there seems to be no reason, couple that with skimming through the wit and I can only conclude you had no understanding of what Lord Henry was in effect saying.Unfortunately I would not recommend you to read it again. The fact of this thread has probably contaminated any objective reading possible. Let us never speak of Dorian again.
    
  
        
      I would just like to say, that your review of this book could very well be my own. It was scary seeing my own thoughts put into words, especially since I was convinced that I was the only person who wasn&apos;t that fond of this book. 
    
  
        
      Hey Paula, I liked this novel a lot better than you did, but I think all your points are more than valid. Nice review. I think you might like Dorian An Imitation by Will Self a lot more. If you can stand any more on the Dorian Gray theme, that is. And people - please. You can&apos;t judge a person&apos;s individual response to art as &apos;wrong&apos; - and it&apos;s this kind of flaming which makes me reticent to review things honestly incase someone starts telling me I&apos;m stupid because I don&apos;t think exactly like them. 
    
  
        
      i totally agree... the book is about 100 pages or so too long... say after the first chapter just skip and read the last 100 pages. if you take out all the sh*t in the middle... it&apos;s not bad
    
  
        
      @Courtney - haha I see you found the review I told you about :)@Hannah - I completely agree. People respond differently to things. It doesn&apos;t always mean they &quot;didn&apos;t get it&quot; or are &quot;too stupid&quot; to understand. Sometimes things just don&apos;t resonate. 
    
  
        
      Well this thread got completely ridiculous. Has everyone had a chance to vent their spleen yet?
    
  
        
      I&apos;ll be honest. I skimmed through this review. Having not finished the work in full, I was left with the impression that the author had a lot to say about the topic, and was clearly infatuated with its subject matter. It was only later that I found the author drifting from her purpose, stumbling upon the realm of Quixote and Lolita for reasons my unsuccessful attempt at the work could not illuminate. Like Frankenstein, it starts out with a great premise: What if I read the body of work I was reviewing? Would I find myself in a position to judge it more accurately? An interesting premise, to be sure, but just not one I was able to hold onto by the time I reached the third paragraph. It was at around this time of submission that I realized I had to come up with an excuse for not liking the review. Taking a page out of Paula&apos;s book (of which I can assume roughly half are missing), I decided the best course of action was to imitate the writing style in the worst conceivable way possible. Look, reader, look. See Paula. See Paula spew nonsense from every orifice. Spew, Paula, spew!Paula semi-consciously (anesthesia?) makes a Faustian bargain to transfer all her bad writing to Goodreads. She writes terribly and feels guilty about it, but keeps doing it anyway. I finally decide to get rid of the terrible review and close my browser. Surprise, it breaks the spell, and the review is left ugly, old and dead while my rationale returns to its original form. The end. You can thank me later.  
    
  
        
      So... you read and disliked the review and 28 comments so much that you wrote your own. Okay then. I don&apos;t know why this damn thread is so popular. I read this book almost 2 years ago and have since moved on with life. I suggest future would-be posters do so as well.
    
  
        
      To clarify, the suggestion to move on was a general suggestion to all posters, not a personal one. Let&apos;s all collectively find books more worthwhile of debate. Thanks, the management.
    
  
      Exactly what I actually think... =)
    
  
        
      People keep coming back to the review because it&apos;s at the top of the page. I trust you recognize the irony in complaining that people are commenting 2 years later on a review of a book written 120 years ago? A review posted online where people can encounter it for the first time for years to come? You open your review stating that you hate classics. Argumentum ad hominem isn&apos;t always fallacious, as sometimes the character or motive of the person in question are relevant. Having immediately established that you hate classic literature, you invalidate almost any argument that follows. And your argument is merely that the book is too wordy and Lord Harry too witty. And then you confess to skimming. In this case you have virtually asked for ad hominem criticism, and I think there is a certain validity to it.Following up with context-less snippets from reviews stating simply that Dorian Gray is less successful than Wilde&apos;s plays (a fair critique) does not back up the assertion that the book is bad or deserving of hate. Ur unworthy of discussion.But I agree that the description feels endless! I might love it as a short story. As a novel it dragged. The jewel collecting bit was especially rough.
    
  
        
      OR, not ur. sad.
    
  
        
      i get where your&apos;e coming from, it does kind of drag on, and henry is pretty annoying, and hard to understand at times, but i still have to say i liked the book nevertheles. what can i say, im an oscar wilde fan :)
    
  
        
      Oh dear Paula – I&apos;m not going to start insulting you over your review. I can see you received a lot of “stick” for this already. And I&apos;m assuming its because this book “touched” many people who read itI greatly admire this book. But not when I first read it (which was years ago when I was a school kid). And even the second time I read it (aged 21), I was dubious as to my thoughts regarding its merits. I felt that it was very witty and challenging, but I found myself skipping pages to get to the crucial bits of the plot. However, my third time, I was fascinated, repulsed, horrified and obsessed with with the book.I ventured to read it a third time because I&apos;d had just watched a brilliant ballet production (based on the book) at Saddlers Wells theatre (Angel, London) and I suppose I was in a morbid frame of mind. I decided another perusal of this book was necessary and that&apos;s when I appreciated it. It was morbid, gothic, and left me haunted. I began in fact researching the effects of opium and started paying more attention to the heroin addicts at the homeless shelter (as well as donating to charities which dealt with education and prevention). Hence, may be its just one of those books you need to read again. I&apos;m not entirely sure, but its definitely not for everyone&apos;s taste, I agree. (Sorry for &quot;still&quot; going on about it!!)
    
  
        
      i completely agree with you
    
  
        
      I&apos;ve read several classics now and have to agree that this particular book is purple prosed and has a ton of pointless rambling going on. I did not feel that was so with Frankenstein though. I liked Frankenstein quite a bit more. I&apos;ve read Dracula, Frankenstein&apos;s Monster, Pride and Prejudice, but I really felt the Picture of Dorian Gray was a &quot;meh&quot; book at best.
    
  
        
      This book is a vehicle for Henry&apos;s paradoxical epigrams. Criticisms of character or plot are probably warranted. If you don&apos;t like Henry spouting off, you won&apos;t enjoy the book. I found it adorable.
    
  
        
      The twist is that the knife ends up in him rather than the painting. If you hated the book you&apos;re more than likely to despise the recent film adaptation. I mean, I *liked* the book but the film. Well. It was shit.
    
  
        
      I&apos;ve read your review and subsequent comments (entertaining, if not meanspirited) and I&apos;m still undecide if I should read this book. As a rule I prefer not to read reviews by people who&apos;ve skimmed the content, but I think it&apos;s okay to review after skimming provided the reviewer makes us aware of the skimming. I also think the desire to skim speaks louder than any review!People may not agree with your point of view, but at least (unlike a review a read a few weeks ago) you are reviewing the book and not the film :-/I think I will enjoy the sunshine as I walk to the public library then I shall let availability decide if it&apos;s my time to read this book.
    
  
        
      I don&apos;t think it&apos;s fair that you&apos;ve written a review and blatantly state that you only &quot;skimmed&quot; the novel. How do you really know the content then? I understand that long descriptions bore people and random tangents can be quite annoying to get through, but simply skipping over entire sections or skimming lightly doesn&apos;t do it justice. Also, in regards to Deb&apos;s comment above, Wilde himself wrote in a letter: &quot;Basil Hallward is what I think I am: Lord Henry is what the world thinks me: Dorian is what I would like to be.&quot; So yes, you&apos;ve completely proven Wilde&apos;s point in saying that Henry &quot;is&quot; Wilde. And of course it&apos;s outdated - it&apos;s from the Victorian period, not this millenium.I hope the main review doesn&apos;t dissuade people from at least picking it up; it&apos;s really an interesting read once you get into the rhythm of it.
    
  
        
      Re: &quot;Seriously, in a 230-page novel, the portrait doesn&apos;t even start to change until 100 pages in.&quot; I think you&apos;re failing to understand that the work is more about character influence and regression, with the portrait serving more as a figurative literary device. You are selling it short and failing to see the bigger picture, as would be expected with a mere &quot;skim&quot; of the novel.
    
  
        
      Paula:&quot;Wilde&apos;s excessive dialogue is better suited to a play and weakens the work as a novel&quot; Im coming in this late but I understand your sentiments in your comment. However I would like to point out that most novels, most great novels of all times consists of mostly dialogues. Especially in older eras. Good examples &apos;War and Peace&apos; and &apos;Crime and Punishment&apos;, those are but a few.
    
  
        
      Thanks for the hilarious review! I wish I had read it before I read Dorian Gray because I completely agree with you. I must say I&apos;m quite surprised by the attacks on your intelligence by other users. It&apos;s shameful, really.
    
  
        
      whitney said it
    
  
        
      so beautiful
    
  
        
      so beautiful
    
  
        
      I disagree, I thought it was a great book. The flowery language was great, too.
    
  
        
      Quite often, during the period in which this book was created, authors were paid by the word. This monetary motivator is quite likely the root of the lengthy, over detailed classics that I have grown to love. The descriptiveness is what really gives you a glimpse into the author&apos;s mind and into the world you are in while reading the book.

           Oh Dorian. Oh Dorian.When I first read this book in the fruitless years of my youth I was excited, overwhelmed and a blank slate (as Dorian is, upon his first encounter with Lord Henry) easily molded, persuaded, influenced, etc.Certain Wildisms (Wildeisms?) would take my breath away. Would become my mottos to believe in. To follow. To live.Lines like:&quot;It is silly of you, for there is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about.&quot;&quot;But beauty, real beauty, ends where an intellectual expression begins. Intellect is in itself a mode of exaggeration, and destroys the harmony of any face.&quot;&quot;If they know nothing of victory, they are at least spared the knowledge of defeat.&quot;&quot;Genius lasts longer than Beauty. That accounts for the fact that we all take such pains to over-educate ourselves. In the wild struggle for existence, we want to have something that endures, and so we fill our minds with rubbish and facts, in the silly hope of keeping our place.&quot;&quot;You know more than you think you know, just as you know less than you want to know.&quot;Re-reading this masterpiece and coming upon these highlighted lines was possibly more interesting than the book this time. Why had I highlighted these lines? Do they still mean the same thing to me, as they did when I first took note of them, enough to highlight them? I still love all of those lines. But no longer feel so strongly for them.Now these are lines that stick out still to me. Or were newly underlined on the second pass through. New Wildisms to mold me.&quot;Oh, I can&apos;t explain. When I like people immensely I never tell their names to any one. It is like surrendering a part of them. I have grown to love secrecy. It seems to be the one thing that can make modern life mysterious or marvelous to us. The commonest thing is delightful if one only hides it. When I leave town now I never tell my people where I am going. If I did, I would lose all my pleasure. It is a silly habit, I dare say, but somehow it seems to bring a great deal of romance into one&apos;s life. I suppose you think me awfully foolish about it?&quot;&quot;Yes; she is a peacock in everything but beauty.&quot;&quot;Laughter is not at all a bad beginning for a friendship, and it is far the best ending for one.&quot;&quot;I choose my friends for their good looks, my acquaintances for their good characters, and my enemies for their good intellects.&quot;&quot;Ah! this Morning! You have lived since then.&quot;&quot;what brings you out so early? I thought you dandies never got up till two, and were not visible till five.&quot; --A new personal favorite. That I follow very seriously.&quot;She behaves as if she was beautiful. Most American women do. It is the secret of their charm.&quot;&apos;He thought for a moment. &quot;Can you remember any great error that you committed in your early days, Duchess?&quot; he asked, looking at her across the table. &quot;A great many, I fear,&quot; she cried.&quot;Then commit them over again,&quot; he said, gravely. &quot;To get back one&apos;s youth one has merely to repeat one&apos;s follies.&quot;&quot;A delightful theory!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot; I must put it into practice.&quot;&quot;Besides, each time that one loves is the only time one has ever loved. Difference of object does not alter singleness of passion.&quot;It turns out that all of these quotes occur in the first 45 pages, except that last one which is right near the end. And it seems most of my reviews end up being mostly quotes from the book itself, but I figure this is what shaped and informed my reading, so I want to share it with all of you. What do you think of it all?That said, poor Sybil Vane! Poor James Vane! Poor Basil Hallward! Shit, even poor old Lord Henry Wotton! And Dorian! Oh Dorian! Lead the life you did and for what? That&apos;s all I am going to say about the book. I don&apos;t think I shall read Against Nature, for fear of being seduced like Dorian.If you&apos;re tired of this review or just tired in general, stop now and come back later. I am going to include two more quotes from the book that truly fucked me up. So much I had to read them at least 3 times in a row. And then transcribe them here for you. The last section, thats the one that did it. Beautiful.Here goes:&quot;There is no such thing as a good influence, Mr. Gray. All influence is immoral-immoral from the scientific point of view.&quot;&quot;Why?&quot;&quot;Because to influence a person is to give him one&apos;s own soul. He does not think his natural thoughts, or burn with his natural passions. His virtues are not real to him. His sins, if there are such things as sins, are borrowed. He becomes an echo of some one else&apos;s music, an actor of a part that has not been written for him. The aim of life is self-development. To realize one&apos;s nature perfectly-that is what each of us is here for. People are afraid of themselves nowadays. They have forgotten the highest of all duties, the duty that one owes to one&apos;s self. Of course they are charitable. They feed the hungry and cloth the beggar. But their own souls starve, and are naked. Courage has gone out of our race. Perhaps we never really had it. The terror of society, which is the basis of morals; the terror of God, which is the secret of religion-these are the two things that govern us. And yet-&quot;&quot;And yet,&quot; continues Lord Henry, in his low, musical voice,&quot;I believe that if one man were to live out his life fully and completely, were to give form to every feeling, expression to every thought, reality to every dream-I believe that the world would gain such a fresh impulse of joy that we would forget all the maladies of mediaevalism, and return to the Hellenic ideal-to something finer, richer than the Hellenic ideal, it may be. But the bravest man among us is afraid of himself. The mutilation of the savage has its tragic survival in the self-denial that mars our lives. We are punished for our refusals. Every impulse that we strive to strangle broods in the mind and poisons us. The body sins once, and has done with its sins, for action is a mode of purification. Nothing remains then but the recollection of a pleasure, or the luxury of a regret. The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it. Resist it, and your soul grows sick with longing for the things it has forbidden to itself, with desire for what its monstrous laws have made monstrous and unlawful. It has been said that the great events of the world take place in the brain. It is in the brain, and the brain only, that the great sins of the world take place also. You, Mr. Gray, you yourself, with your rose-red youth and your rose-white boyhood, you have had passions that have made you afraid, thoughts that have filled you with terror, day-dreams and sleeping dreams whose mere memory might stain your cheek with shame-&quot;&quot;Stop!&quot; faltered Dorian Gray, &quot;stop! you bewilder me. I don&apos;t know what to say. There is some answer to you, but I cannot find it. Don&apos;t speak. Let me think, or, rather, let me try not to think.&quot;Whew.And:&quot;There are few of us who have not sometimes wakened before dawn, either after one of those dreamless nights that make us almost enamored of death, or one of those nights of horror and misshapen joy, when through the chambers of the brain sweep phantoms more terrible than reality itself, and instinct with that vivid life that lurks in all grotesques, and that lends to Gothic art its enduring vitality, this art being, one might fancy, especially the art of those who minds have been troubled with the malady of reverie. Gradually white fingers creep through the curtains, and they appear to tremble. In black, fantastic shapes, dumb shadows crawl into the corners of the room, and crouch there. Outside, there is the stirring of the birds among the leaves, or the sound of men going forth to their work, or the sigh and sob of the wind coming down from the hills and wandering round the silent house, as though it feared to wake the sleeper, and yet must needs call forth Sleep from her purple cave. Veil after veil of thin, dusky gauze is lifted, and by degrees the forms and colors of things are restored to them, and we watch the dawn remaking the world in its antique pattern. The wan mirrors get back their mimic life. The flameless tapers stand where we had left them, and beside them lies the half-cut book that we had been studying, or the wired flower that we had worn at the ball, or the letter we had been afraid to read, or that we had read too often. Nothing seems to us changed. Out of the unreal shadows of the night comes back the real life that we had known. We have to resume it where we had left off, and there steals over us a terrible sense of the necessity for the continuance of energy in the same wearisome round of stereotyped habits, or a wild longing, it may be, that our eyelids might open some morning upon a world that had been refashioned anew in the darkness for our pleasure, a world in which things would have fresh shapes and colors, and be changed, or have other secrets, a world in which the past would have little or no place, or survive, at any rate, in no conscious form of obligation or regret, the remembrance even of joy having its bitterness, and the memories of pleasure their pain.&quot;Yep.

It was nagging-- to say the least-- not to recall who wrote them. Thank you! To me, it is precisely in the articulation of these thoughts (the final two sections you quote) where Wilde is creditable for genius. The other pieces are fun and insightful but are too easily dismissed to resonate in any subversive manner. These latter excerpts are much more sinister, don&apos;t you think? Much more exciting.
    
  
        
      Oscar Wilde just had &apos;it.&apos; The English language was invented for his &apos;devilish&apos; purposes.
    
  
        
      i guess that&apos;s pretty much the only way to write a review of this damn book. Is to cut it up Bartletts. The quotes are amazing though. A story in their own, in each line: &quot;Laughter is not at all a bad beginning for a friendship, and it is far the best ending for one.&quot; What a sad line! Too bad they&apos;re all lost in the headache of nonchalant wit. It&apos;s like being trapped inside of a pretty fortune cookie factory.
    
  
        
      Those flowery speeches were what I didn`t like about the book.
    
  
        
      I find it hard to believe that only your youth was fruitless if you are still only getting up at 2 and not getting about until 4. Sounds like your whole life is fruitless especially if you are willing to take in hook line and sinker that first longer paragraph.Its a well written book but living by the witticisms of Henry the Arch tempter sounds like a good way to end up not only looking like the portrait but having a soul so soiled and wretched that would make rotten maggot infested flesh look charming in comparison.The part about influencing a person is empty flowery language devoid of any scientific, psychological, anthropological, philosophical or spiritual meaning. &apos;Sin is a mode of purification&apos;- what a load of horse shit. Only by controling ones animal urges can one truly be free. A self willed man or woman of self control is the highest state of man. Do you actually believe that becoming a slave to your desires lifts you up to some higher state. What he speaks of is no Hellenic ideal it is not even an ideal it is the total lack of ideal.

      Such an affectiing, fascinating, amazing book...such incredible quotations! I was thus affected by very few other books!
    
  
        
      I liked this review almost as much as I liked the book!
    
  
        
      A just contrast to the above (deficient) account.
    
  
        
      All my fav lines are here! and i too have highlighted the same in my copy of the book! am over-whelmed!
    
  
        
      You pulled a lot of great quotes! They all stood out so well, esp &quot;&quot;It is silly of you, for there is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about.&quot; &quot;
    
  
        
      Although you have gather almost all my favorite lines out of this book, the one I feel that is missing is:&quot;Nothing makes one so vain as being told one is a sinner. Conscience makes egotists of us all.&quot;
    
  
        
      I absolutely love your choice of quotes from this beautiful story!
    
  
        
      wow! it&apos;s been a while since i read the books, but reading these quotes made me remember exactly how i felt about it. you managed to pick nearly all of my favourite quotes...damn, i feel so unorigional, thinking these were my faves and mine alone..
    
  
        
      As it was, we always misunderstood ourselves, and rarely understood others. Experience was of no ethical value. It was merely the name men gave to their mistakes. Moralists had, as a rule, regarded it as a mode of warning, had claimed for it a certain ethical efficacy in the formation of character, had praised it as something that taught us what to follow and showed us what to avoid. But there was no motive power in experience. It was as little of an active cause as conscience itself. All that it really demonstrated was that our future would be the same as our past, and that the sin we had done once, and with loathing, we would do many times, and with joy.Yep.
    
  
        
      I read this book long ago, I am new here and I was asked to vote for, &quot;Best Horror Books by People Other Than Stephen King&quot;. Now there was quite a list, but this incredible book was not listed on it. I placed it there as it sent chills through me years ago, and now reading all your quotes I know I must read it again. I know it is not horror in today&apos;s standards but for me I find peoples life decisions to sometime be the most terrifying. Thank you for this review stunning!
    
  
        
      Great selections.. The lines you quote are simply wonderful.. The whole thing from cover to cover is worthy to be quoted.
    
  
        
      I really like your review, I almost highlighted same quotes and must one that lived and ruined me as well the influence long part. great book I really enjoy reading it.. now I am looking forward to watch every play or movie done..
    
  
        
      what&apos;s the meaning of purple cave?
    
  
        
      Your quotes were phenomenal choices 
    
  
        
      ❤❤❤
    
  
        
      I loved this review!
    
  
        
      One of the cleverest books I&apos;ve ever read. Great review and great quotes.
    
  
        
      I agree! Wilde has so many fantastic quotes in this book. Whether it be clever tongue-in-cheek humor or intriguing aphorisms, he really pulls through with resounding quotes. Though quite dark in some instances, his quotes are rather relatable for most people. I would say they expose human nature and the deep desires that we all secretly possess. Personally, one of my favorite quotes of the entire novel is “there is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about.” The quote can easily to relate to many people in the world, and perhaps I can secretly apply it to my own life. Like Wilde, I can also be quite the dramatist.
    
  
        
      I love your choice of quotes! Fantastic review!

    &quot;The sitter is merely the accident, the occasion. It is not he who is revealed by the painter; it is rather the painter who, on the coloured canvas, reveals himself. The reason I will not exhibit this picture is that I am afraid that I have shown in it the secret of my own soul.&quot;
  
And so begins this tale of art and sin. I would highly recommend first watching the movie Wilde, a film which takes the audience on a journey through the life of the tormented writer, from the beginnings of his fame to his later incarceration for &quot;gross indecency&quot; - a charge used to imprison individuals when it was impossible to prove sodomy. Wilde was sentenced to two years hard labour and died not long after being freed due to health problems gained during those two years. Looking at Wilde&apos;s story from a twenty-first century perspective, it is sad and horrifying to realise this man was indirectly sentenced to death for being gay. The &quot;hard labour&quot; prescribed was carried out in various ways but one of the most common was the treadmill:This machine made prisoners walk continuously uphill for hours on end and had many long-term effects on people&apos;s health.Why do I think it&apos;s important to know this? Because, as Wilde claims, in every piece of art there is more of the artist than anything else. And I believe this is especially true of The Picture of Dorian Gray more than perhaps any other fictional work I&apos;ve read. In this novel, Wilde explores the nature of sin, of morality and immorality. The homoerotic undertones between Dorian Gray, Basil Hallward and Lord Henry Wotton are, I think, the author&apos;s little expression of his own secret &quot;sins&quot; within his work. Rarely does a work of fiction so deeply seem to mirror elements of the author&apos;s life.By 1891, when The Picture of Dorian Gray was published, Oscar Wilde had met and fallen in love with Lord Alfred Douglas and they had begun a semi-secret affair. By which I mean that many were suspicious of the relationship but didn&apos;t argue with Wilde&apos;s claims that they shared a Socrates/Plato teacher/student kind of love. The idolisation of Dorian Gray&apos;s youth and beauty, his tendency to be mean at random... these characteristics all fit with the description and personality of Lord Alfred Douglas. For me, there is no real question as to whether part of Dorian is meant to be Mr Wilde&apos;s lover.I think if you familiarise yourself with Oscar Wilde, this becomes a very personal novel, much more than just a disturbing horror story where a man sells his soul. But even without any additional information, I think this is a sad and haunting book that tells of the joyful naivete of youth and the sad wisdom of maturity.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube

      Great review. Wow, you really crank through books, good work!
    
  
        
      Thanks! I&apos;m getting in all the reading I can before my new term at uni starts and I have no time :(
    
  
        
      Ooo yeah, good luck! Tough classes this semester? I&apos;m trying to sneak in Infinite Jest this semester since my real reading intensive classes are next semester, so I know the feeling. Getting a lot of the good classics in though, been nice reading your reviews.
    
  
        
      I know :( I would really recommend watching the movie Wilde, it&apos;s very good.
    
  
        
      Yeah, that one. I loved it but it&apos;s quite sad.
    
  
        
      What&apos;s the difference between the regular edition of the novel compared to the uncensored version? I haven&apos;t read the novel yet. Which one do you recommend to read first?
    
  
        
      Great review, I didn&apos;t know there was a movie, Thank-you.

      Thinking about the initial reactions for this book makes me so sad. Also thinking about what they did to Mr. Wilde just because he was homosexual is quite depressing. I wish he could be brought to life again for him to see how much The Picture of Dorian Gray is now appreciated.Great review!

      I&apos;m currently reading it. And Em, to be honest, I think Wilde wanted to portray a quixotic man in Dorian Gray but he simply came off as an effeminate man.By the way, Lord Henry sounds very sexist to me!

Check out the uncensored quotes and see if you still feel the same: http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011...Also, yes. I don&apos;t remember exactly but I&apos;m sure the novel was very sexist, given the time it was written.
    
  
        
      EM, no really! lolThat was what occurred to me as well. I mean Its being gay romance is quite apparent, actually! Thanks for the link though :)
    
  
        
      Interestingly, I feel the censored version didn&apos;t make much of a difference to the actual implications of Hallward&apos;s statements. I mean it was quite clear that somehow the relationship wasn&apos;t what it&apos;s normally supposed to be. What you think?
    
  
      A classic must read!
    
  
        
      I love the book and film. Read the book in Uni. Who wouldn&apos;t sell their soul and stay young forever living a hedonistic shallow life whilst being admired..of course the book shows the consequences of what a ugly person you will become and that&apos;s the genius of the book.

           So I read all of Wilde&apos;s plays a couple of years ago but for some reason I never read this at the time. This is probably the number one most requested book for me to read. So I read it. Are ya happy now!? ARE YA!?I really rather enjoyed this. Well, obviously. I mean, did you honestly think I wasn&apos;t going to like The Picture of Dorian Gray? It&apos;s by Oscar Wilde for fuck&apos;s sake. His prose is like spilled honey flowing across a wooden table and waterfalling onto the floor beneath. The viscous liquid flowing slowly over the edge. His plot, perfectly paced, moves slowly as we wade deeper and deeper into Dorian Gray&apos;s maniacal life. Over the edge we go as everything goes wrong, there&apos;s death, there&apos;s pain, there&apos;s long conversations about art. We hit the floor as we finish and we see nothing but sweetness amassing around us as we escape from Wilde&apos;s prose. Putting the book down you see the light has hit the stream and it glows and it shines and it sparkles and you stand there mesmorised by what you&apos;re witnessing and you put the book back on your shelf and feel sorry for the book you read next. So, yeah, it&apos;s good. 
         
        
      Great review! Can&apos;t wait to read it =D

      what an enticing and captivating review ....
    
  
        
      I NEED TO READ THIS ASAP!
    
  
        
      I think I&apos;d rather read your reviews. Nicely done!
    
  
        
      there is something seductive about this review, maybe those images of honey sticking onto everything....it&apos;s a great read for sure, the kind of book where you want to underline EVERYTHING.
    
  
        
      You have a lyrical turn of phrase that is breathtaking to read. Your review indicates an intuitive grasp of Wilde’s work and a poetical gift. It doesn’t tell what, exactly, we will find inside Wilde’s only novel. But it makes a reader long to be exposed to its darkling light, like a person who’s never known heat might wish to stand next to an open fire. I would thank you for your review but mere recognition of its merits seems too feeble to express my awe and appreciation of your mellifluence.
    
  
        
      Can I be your friend Barry?

           ”He grew more and more enamoured of his own beauty, more and more interested in the corruption of his own soul.”I think I must have been about fifteen when I read “The Picture of Dorian Gray” for the very first time and I was totally blown away by it. There was this book, written in such a beautiful way, using such colourful and flowery language and there were those three amazing characters that made me feel and wonder and question their lives and decisions! You might say that up until I picked up “The Picture of Dorian Gray” I was as innocent as Dorian himself. I didn’t know that there were books like that out there, that there actually existed morally grey characters, corrupted characters, book characters that felt like real people and could make you question their behaviour. It was an entirely new world for me and I was totally fascinated by it. So I read this book and I savoured every sentence, I devoured its wisdom and got lost in its pages! Looking at it in retrospective I think that Oscar Wilde actually was the first writer who didn’t only make me love classics but also the first author that ignited my undying love for villains and complex characters. And for that I’ll always be grateful! I don’t know how often I read this book by now (goodreads your count doesn’t even get close to the actual number *lol*), but no matter how often I already read it, I’m still captivated by it. My fifteen year old me loved it as much as my 31 year old me does and if you ask me that’s exactly what makes a good classic. ;-) I’m sure I’ll never get tired of reading this book and I’ll always discover new things about it. And I genuinely hope that many other people will read it as well. It’s definitely worth it! ;-)The characters:
  Warning: You are now entering the gallery of “Spoilery Spoilers” and since this is one of my all-time faves I’ll probably end up writing an entire essay about it. If you prefer to stay innocent you better leave before my spoilers get to you and corrupt your soul! ;-P
Dorian Gray:”It held the secret of his life, and told his story. It had taught him to love his own beauty. Would it teach him to loathe his own soul?” Dorian Gray! I don’t even know where to start! I love his character to bits and pieces and he’s definitely one of the most intriguing book characters I ever had the pleasure to read about. At the beginning of the book he’s so innocent and naïve and I totally agree with Lord Henry when he says that this is charming. Dorian definitely is a charming character! He’s beautiful and pure and whenever I read the beginning of the book I get a sudden urge to protect him against everything that’s going to happen over the course of those 256 pages! He’s like a child that gets corrupted by the bad influence of others and when I write this I really mean it! Even at his worst he still seems to retain that innocent outlook at things. I mean he was corrupted and tainted by Lord Henry, and he ends up corrupting and tainting his friends but despite all of this he still wonders why they have become like that. He’s completely oblivious to his own role in their downfall and when Basil confronts him with it, he doesn’t believe him. He is convinced that his friends could have done the right thing and that his influence on them isn’t as strong as Basil claims it to be. What is even more intriguing is that Dorian actually wants to be good! There’s a part of him that’s still innocent and hopes that he can be redeemed, but there’s also that other side of him that whispers that he’s entitled to do whatever he wishes to do. It’s obvious that he’s fighting an inner struggle and that he seems to have lost his way. It’s the century old question every person has to ask her/himself. Do I want to be good? And even more important: Can I resist being bad? It’s so easy to do the wrong thing and it’s so tough to do what’s right. I mean that’s the main reason why actors and role-players love to be the baddies! Being bad is fun, it gives you a lot of freedom and if you’re good at it the consequences never catch up to you. ;-P So Dorian constantly finds himself at a crossroads. Will he do the right thing or is he going to give into his bad side? Is his bad side truly that bad? Is having a little fun with his friends and to indulge in pleasure wrong or is it just a part of being human? The fate of Dorian Gray makes you think and it involuntarily causes you to face your own demons and weaknesses. It ultimately causes you to acknowledge your own vices and fears. In short: It makes you pause and forces you to ponder your own life-choices! And this is nothing but awesome! XD”I want to be good. I can’t bear the idea of my soul being hideous.” ”He felt that the time had really come for making his choice. Or had his choice already been made? Yes, life had decided that for him – life, and his own infinite curiosity about life. Eternal youth, infinite passion, pleasures subtle and secret, wild joys and wilder sins – he was to have all these things. The portrait was to bear the burden of his shame: that was all.””I don’t want to be at the mercy of my emotions. I want to use them, to enjoy them and to dominate them.” ”He was prisoned in thought. Memory, like a horrible malady, was eating his soul away.”Lord Henry:”You seem to forget that I am married, and the one charm of marriage is that it makes a life of deception absolutely necessary for both parties. I never know where my wife is, and my wife never knows what I am doing.” Ahh Lord Henry! How much I love that bastard! *lol* He’s quite literally the devil in this book. He’s the person that stirrs Dorian’s soul! He’s the man who leads him down that dark road and just like Dorian he is completely oblivious to the magnitude of his influence! Yes, he knows that he’s corrupting Dorian, he even finds pleasure and joy in it, but throughout the entire book he never truly realizes how much his words actually changed him! How much damage they did to his soul! Lord Henry is the kind of character you just got to love. Arrogant, intelligent, wise, self-confident, brutally honest and completely unapologetic about his inappropriate behaviour. It’s no wonder Dorian is so fascinated by him and isn’t only willing but also eager to spend his time in his company. Lord Henry is basically the embodiment of temptation and young and innocent Dorian wants to be seduced! And honestly, who wouldn’t be drawn towards a character like Lord Henry? I swear he says the wisest things and vocalizes the most accurate statements regarding society! He’s exactly the kind of devil you’d love to have on your shoulder! Plus there’s so much truth in his words that it hurts! XD”I make a great difference between people. I choose my friends for their good looks, my acquaintances for their good characters, and my enemies for their good intellects. A man cannot be too careful in the choice of his enemies.””I like persons better than principles, and I like persons with no principles better than anything else in the world.” ”We are punished for our refusals. Every impulse that we strive to strangle broods in the mind, and poisons us. The body sins once, and has done with its sin, for action is a mode of purification. Nothing remains then but the recollection of a pleasure, or the luxury of a regret. The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it.” Basil Hallward:”When I like people immensely I never tell their names to anyone. It is like surrendering a part of them. I have grown to love secrecy.” If Lord Henry is the devil on Dorian’s shoulder then Basil certainly is the angel that sits on his other side. The painter functions as Dorian’s consciousness and as long as they know each other he always appeals to his good side and tries his best to sway him on a righteous path. He’s clearly the counterweight to Lord Henry’s corruption, but unfortunately he doesn’t have a lot of leverage. Well, at least not as much as Harry does! I mean the saying: “Come to the dark side, we got cookies” exists for a reason, right? ;-P In the end Dorian can’t stand his bad conscience any longer and does the only thing that’s seemingly able to liberate him. He kills Basil in order to silence his remorse and regrets, but what he didn’t expect is that this dark deed makes him feel even more tainted and guilty. So in the end Basil’s death only increased his sense of guilt and caused him to feel even more haunted. In my opinion the murder of Basil is the final nail in Dorian’s coffin and from that moment on he couldn’t be saved anymore. ”You were the most unspoiled creature in the whole world. Now, I don’t know what has come over you. You talk as if you had no heart, no pity in you.” The relationships:Dorian Gray &amp; Basil Hallward:”He won’t like you the better for keeping your promises. He always breaks his own. I beg you not to go.” Dorian Gray laughed and shook his head.“I entreat you.”The lad hesitated, and looked over at Lord Henry, who was watching them from the tea-table with an amused smile.“I must go, Basil,” he answered.And this is the key moment! The very first time Dorian Gray finds himself at a crossroads and choses the wrong path. You gotta love Oscar Wilde for the subtle intensity of this scene! There’s nothing extraordinary or special about it, yet it’s still the first choice that leads Dorian down his dark descent. It’s unagitated, ordinary and so very powerful! It’s obvious Basil loved Dorian and when I talk about love here, I’m talking about true love and not just friendship. He’s infatuated with him and basically worships the young and innocent Dorian. After he realises what Dorian has become, it’s already too late for him though. Poor Basil, if he would have known what his picture would make of Dorian, if he would have known how much Lord Henry’s negative influence would change his innocent and pure friend…. ”One has a right to judge of a man by the effect he has over his friends. Yours seem to lose all sense of honour, of goodness, of purity. You have filled them with a madness for pleasure. They have gone down into the depths. You led them there.” ”There was nothing evil in it, nothing shameful. You were to me such an ideal as I shall never meet again. This is the face of a satyr.”“It is the face of my soul.”“Christ! what a thing I must have worshipped! It has the eyes of a devil.”“Each of us has Heaven and Hell in him, Basil,” cried Dorian, with a wild gesture of despair.Dorian Gray &amp; Lord Henry:”Words! Mere words! How terrible they were! How clear, and vivid and cruel! One could not escape from them. And yet what a subtle magic there was in them!”Okay, and here comes the moment when I say that Lord Henry and Dorian Gray are in love with each other. *lol* It’s so freaking obvious!! They are fascinated by each other, they are besotted with each other and they want to spend every free moment in each other’s company! So yeah, there’s that! I think their dynamic and their interactions are very interesting and to me it seems like Lord Henry is some sort of catalyst. He’s the impulse that changes Dorian’s soul, he’s the first person who opens Dorian’s eyes and tells him that he’s beautiful. Oscar Wilde uses him as his tool to initiate Dorian’s monumental change. Which is kind of interesting, if you consider that Oscar Wilde was gay. It feels like Dorian’s and Henry’s relationship is wrong and I’m not even sure if Wilde was aware of that? I mean yes, their friendship led Dorian into the abyss of his soul, which is pretty obvious if you ask me, but there’s some subtle note about their “relationship”. It’s like deep down Oscar Wilde thought that it was wrong to have intense feelings for another man. And if you consider the time in which this was written it’s not surprising that he might have felt that way. Lord Henry represents Oscar’s sins and vices and it becomes quite apparent that some small part of him might have bemoaned his sexual orientation. In contrast to Wilde no one holds Dorian Gray to account though. He gets away with all of his sins and in the end this eventually causes him to destroys himself! What a moral punchline! XD”Talking to him was like playing upon an exquisite violin. He answered to every touch and thrill of the bow…””Yes,” continued Lord Henry, “that is one of the great secrets of life – to cure the soul by means of the senses, and the senses by means of the soul. You are a wonderful creation. You know more than you think you know, just as you know less than you want to know.””The moment I met you I saw that you were quite unconscious of what you really are, of what you really might be. There was so much in you that charmed me that I felt I must tell you something about yourself. I thought how tragic it would be if you were wasted.&quot;You know how a voice can stir one. Your voice and the voice of Sibyl Vane are two things that I shall never forget. When I close my eyes, I hear them, and each of them says something different. I don&apos;t know which to follow.&quot;”The soul is a terrible reality. It can be bought, and sold, and bartered away. It can be poisoned, or made perfect. There is a soul in each one of us. I know it.”Conclusion:This book is a gem! It’s perfection and so quotable that I could probably highlight each and every single passage! No matter how often I read it, there is always something new I didn’t notice before! I still wonder and guess about certain characters and “The Picture of Dorian Gray” still causes me to think. The writing style is so beautiful I can’t help but fall in love with it. I fall in love with this book over and over again. Every time I read it I love it even more and I’m sure that I will adore this masterpiece until I’m wrinkled and old. Oscar Wilde drags us into the dark depths of the human soul, and once you get there you don’t want to return to the surface anymore.P.E.R.F.E.C.T.I.O.N!That’s what this book is. &lt;333

      Holy Moly, Virginia, I just read your Cliff Notes review of &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; and I must say that you convinced me to read it. I knew it was a classic and others here have read it, but you really got down to the gest of it. So yes, I&apos;ll check it out. This is the second time you made me want to read a book.

           I finished reading this last night, and afterwards I spent an entire hour staring into space so I could contemplate over the majesty of this work. It left me speechless. This book is exquisite; it is an investigation into the human soul, the power of vanity and the problems of living a life with not a single consequence for your actions. It’s truly powerful stuff. It begins with a simple realisation, and perhaps an obvious one. But, for Dorian it is completely life changing. He realises that beauty is finite. It won’t last forever. It’s like a flower, temporary and splendid. So if you’re a young man whose appearance is your singular quality, then this is some damn scary news. People only want to be with you because you’re attractive and charming; they want to be near you, and with you, for your looks only. So when that goes what do you have left? Nothing. No friends. No love. Only age. So what do you do? How do you retain your singular quality? Well, the answer is simple, you copy Doctor Faustus (The Tragical History of the Life and Death of Doctor Faustus) and sell your soul to the devil!&quot;How sad it is!&quot; murmured Dorian Gray with his eyes still fixed upon his own portrait. &quot;How sad it is! I shall grow old, and horrible, and dreadful. But this picture will remain always young. It will never be older than this particular day of June. . . . If it were only the other way! If it were I who was to be always young, and the picture that was to grow old! For that -- for that -- I would give everything! Yes, there is nothing in the whole world I would not give! I would give my soul for that!&quot;  And this is where the real depravity begins. Dorian’s world has no consequences. Everything he does is attributed to the painting, everything. Any regret or malice leaves him quickly and is transferred to the canvas. So he can’t technically feel emotion for an extended period of time; thus, his attitude becomes one of nonchalance. He becomes a shell, an emotionless creature who can only seek his sin: vanity. He surrounds himself with beauty. His house is full of art, brilliant music and every luxury known to man. You name it. Dorian’s got it. Only through seeking new experiences, these pleasures, can Dorian’s being remain animated. I intentionally used the word “being” for Dorian’s body no longer harbours his soul; it’s in the painting. Everything he does is for his own indulgence; he just doesn’t care what affect his presence has on others. The prefect moment is all he lives for. “I don&apos;t want to be at the mercy of my emotions. I want to use them, to enjoy them, and to dominate them.”The character of Dorian Gray is an interesting study because he is representative of many things. He shows how a seemingly pure soul can be corrupted if it’s left in a sense of privation and given terrible guidance. Also he is suggestive of the Victorian ideal of the perfect societal image. One must be respectable at all times, and have all the appropriate airs and graces. But behind closed doors, or perhaps even a curtain, anything goes. He is suggestive of the hidden evils of Victorian society as behind the mask was many dark things. For example, the Empire and colonialism to the Victorians was a wonderful thing; it built wealth and structure, but in reality it destroyed culture and subjected peoples to slavery. The same things can be said of child labour, the exploitation of women and terrible working conditions. Everything exists behind a veil of grandeur, and this is no less true for Dorian. The homosexual suggestions are practically ground-breaking. Wilde wasn’t the only Victorian author to suggest such things. Robert Louis Stevenson’s  The Strange Case of Doctor Jekyll and Mr Hyde  can be read in a similar vein, but Wilde was much more explicit. It’s not cryptic; it’s just plain homosexual lust for all to see on the part of Basil and (perhaps?) even Sir Henry later on. It’s still rather horrific that Wilde was actually arrested for homosexual acts. Silly Victorians. The novel also shows that despite being corrupted to such a degree, to commit murder in such a terrible sense, Dorian (the Victorian man?) isn’t beyond all redemption. He can still come back from his deeds and end it all. The ending was perfection. This has great allegorical meaning.

      I love a book that can be so profoundly thought-provoking. A multi-dimensional characters is also one of my most favored aspects of a book, but sadly not as common in modern literature it seems. Fantastic review! I&apos;m even more eager to read this in April during a read-a-thon event. I have a feeling it will only take me a couple of hours; sounds so compelling.

This book is quite short, and it flows beautifuly, so it&apos;s quite esay to get through. Though I did find it wa sone that demanded to be read almost instantly. ;)

      Nice review, Sean !
    
  
        
      Thank you for a review which serves the purpose of informing its audience of the topics which can be connected to the text, and which were-- In your personal intellectual explorations-- prerequisite to forming an overall evaluation of the work. I feel that reviews that present a description of the type of thematic arguments presented in the work; As well as external information. The latter points are introduced in a way which left me able to identify singular facts, without relation to your position. Here I cut short possible tangents and make clear my point.I very much enjoyed your review and commend you for successfully contributing a class of commentary which many find valuable. If you are ever temted to not write what you wish to share, remember that these reviews can end up making a huge difference.

      Insightful review. Well done.
    
  
        
      I have been reading many reviews of this book, so I can decide whether Oscar Wilde&apos;s novel would be a good fit for me. It is outside of the already broad range of books and genres I typically am drawn to.But it is your review that has sold me! As others have already said, it is brilliant. Now I must become one of your followers. I have the idea that this particular review was not a fluke.Thank you. :D

      حينما تمزج الرؤية النص بالنفس، وتتدفق الكتابة على العمل الإبداعي مقتنصة بالعقل فكرته لكنها في الوقت نفسه تستخلص من أعماق كاتبها روحه وشعوره وتفاعله مع الكلمات، قصة القراءة وليست فقط موضوع القراءة هي ما يجذبنا في كلام النقاد، فليقل الناقد إن الفكرة إنسانية راقية، أو إن التقنيات تحمل المعنى بسلاسة، أو إن العمل ناتج عن سياق ثقافي صنعته تقاطعات التاريخ في لحظة بعينها، هذا كلام مهم، لكن الأهم منه هو استقبال الناقد للنص، كيف جرت السطور من حارتها الضيقة في فضاء الصفحة إلى رحاب صفحة النفس، ما الأثر الجمالي الذي حدث في تجربة القراءة؟ هذا ما أجده في مراجعاتك القيمة، وبالنسبة لهذه الرواية تحديدا فهي استشراف عصر الصورة، سؤال يظل دائرا بصدد رؤيتنا لأنفسنا ورؤية الآخرين لنا، إننا نبحث عن شكل يخصنا استقر في ذهن الآخر فندرك شيئا من وجودنا، وهذا ما عبرت عنه مراجعتك حين انتقلت من الخاص عند دوريان جراي الذي رسمه أوسكار وايلد إلى الطبيعة الإنسانية الباحثة عن مرآة عميقة تتجلى فيها بعض من حقيقتها المتوارية في عالمها الذي تراه بمفردها
    
  
        
      &quot;سؤال يظل دائرا بصدد رؤيتنا لأنفسنا ورؤية الآخرين لنا، هذه الجملة بالذات تعبر عن هذه الرواية بشكل عبقري كعادتك يا فؤاد. .🌹اشكرك لكلماتك و افتقدت مرورك العزيز و تعليقاتك الراقية

           The Picture of Dorian Gray is a hard book to review. After reading such eloquent, beautiful, and rich writing, I am at a loss for how to command my comparatively paltry ability to use words to express how I felt about this book.Forgive me as I go back to AP English for a few moments. I asked myself what were the themes of this novel. Here is my list:IdentityExperience BeautyThe triumph on senses over reasonAccountabilityI will attempt to build my review, in part, around the discussion of these themes.IdentityDorian Gray was a flawed man who was essentially empty inside. He was very young when this story began, seemingly full of potential. Sadly, he invested all his sense of worth in his external beauty, doing little to grow the inner man; unless you consider his descent into depravity, discovering more and more excesses for the meaningless value of those experiences (since his mentor Lord Henry taught him that experience has no value), yet he was strangely curious as to how they would affect the portrait of his soul. He was not quite a tragic figure, because I could not feel sorry for him. He had made this horrible decision (and I believe he had opportunities to repent of it, which he didn&apos;t take), but he chose never to take responsibility for himself. Which leads to the next theme.AccountabilityAs I said above, I could feel no sympathy for Dorian Gray. Why? Because he never took responsibility for his actions. Being accountable for one&apos;s own actions is a crucial aspect of self-development, at least in my humble opinion. If a person cannot do that, they are doomed to eternal immaturity. This was Dorian&apos;s fate. It was Basil&apos;s fault for painting the picture. It was Sybil&apos;s fault for being a bad actress, and making him fall out of love with her. All the people he ruined in his relentless pursuit of pleasure and debauchery ruined themselves. He took no part in their ruination. Ultimately, he even blamed the picture, and sought to destroy it as the only true evidence of his black soul. I feel like this: If you&apos;re going to be a bad, selfish person, own up to it. Don&apos;t try to act like your sins should be laid at other people&apos;s feet. That was the route the Mr. Dorian Gray took.ExperienceLord Henry was the man who opens Dorian&apos;s eyes to the fact that the only thing he has to his advantage is the beauty of his youth, that he should enjoy life while he is young enough to experience it fully. He states that experience is not a teacher, and that men don&apos;t learn from the mistakes they make as they live. Your experiences don&apos;t count for anything. It seemed to be a self-fulfilling prophecy for Dorian Gray. Instead of realizing how his selfish, shallow actions could hurt and destroy others, he never did do that. He merely went from one fixation to the other, marking the effects on the portrait that he guarded jealously. In the end, there was no value to what he experienced. He was just wasting time (in my opinion).The triumph of sensation over reasonDorian Gray became a voluptuary, lost in sensations. He didn&apos;t focus on becoming a learned person, only experiencing what he encountered in his pursuits, wallowing in those sensations; until he grew bored, and moved onto the next one. Lord Henry seemed like a good mentor. A man who appeared so intelligent, with a saying for everything. A witty, entertaining man, who had a reputation for saying utterly wicked things. But he wasn&apos;t a deep man. He didn&apos;t believe what he said. It was an image that he projected for lack of anything else to do as an aristocrat who had no need to work for a living. Dorian Gray took this as gospel, and took it to the next level. As a result, it made his life utterly meaningless. Sadly, his friend Basil, who was a fairly wise person, was dismissed, and made fun of by Lord Henry. I almost felt like Basil and Lord Henry were the warring aspects of Dorian&apos;s conscience, at times.BeautyWhat is beauty? I tend to think it&apos;s a double-edged sword. We are all attracted to things that are beautiful, that have a physical appeal. But, should we be content with merely a comely appearance, while the inside is rotted? Dorian Gray was a man of such unearthly beauty that people could not believe he was capable of the debauchery he had committed. Those who didn&apos;t heed the warnings given to them, came to rue it. Basil, who painted the young Dorian&apos;s fateful picture, couldn&apos;t accept that Dorian had become such a horrible person. What a sad fate that was for Basil.I felt several things as I read this book: interest, curiosity, disgust, sadness, and ultimately, a sense that justice had been done, in a very strange, but fitting way.One thing that became very apparent to me as I read this novel, was Oscar Wilde&apos;s considerable wit. I imagine he was quite entertaining to be around. In the preface, Oscar Wilde says that all art is meaningless. What was he trying to say with this story? Nothing?  I have trouble believing that. This was a novel I couldn&apos;t dismiss and treat as mere brain candy. There was some message there that hammered away at my brain. I do believe that Mr. Wilde hints at the subjective nature of art (which includes literature). I think that we could all read the same story and take away different things from it. Our brains are so very different, and the pathways are nurtured and developed by our various experiences, and our own values. So, that we will all come away from viewing a picture or reading a story with a hand-tailored message. Maybe that&apos;s what he means by saying that an artist strives not to be present in his work. Instead, it is a mirror reflecting the viewer. That makes sense to me, actually.What message did I come away with?At the end of the day, I believe that Dorian Gray led a worthless life. His eternal youth counted for nothing. He never grew as a person, and he used the bounteous gifts he&apos;d been given selfishly. He did horrible things that made it even worse. He was lucky in that he didn&apos;t live long enough to count the full cost of those actions. He allowed the portrait to take the weight of those sins intead of letting them rest where they belonged. If anything really bothers me as a person, it&apos;s the thought of my time on this earth being wasted. Never having accomplished anything of value. For that reason, I found Dorian Gray to be a very sad man, but I could not feel sorry for him.So, is this a horror novel, you might ask? I think this is a thinking person&apos;s horror novel. It is a study of how the sins we commit cannot be hidden, even if we lie to ourselves about that. Interestingly enough, Mr. Wilde does not elaborate on what vile acts Dorian committed. We are left to our own expansive imaginations to surmise the bulk of what he&apos;d done. Some people don&apos;t believe in such a thing as sin. If you don&apos;t believe in sin, how could it have a cost? It didn&apos;t matter that Dorian Gray didn&apos;t acknowledge his sins. They caught up with him in the end. The horror is how he confronted the consequences of his sins, yet turned away from them, locking that manifestation away in the attic to view with a detached sort of curiosity. The horror is the lives he destroyed, but never felt more than a moment&apos;s remorse. Fundamentally, Dorian Gray was an angelically beautiful monster. The horror is that we can look upon beauty, and we can be fooled into never asking what lies beneath it.
         
        
      You will surely love it.
    
  
        
      This one is good. Very descriptive. Hope you like it!
    
  
        
      I did like it a lot. I found it pretty readable. I&apos;d like to read more of Oscar Wilde&apos;s prose.
    
  
        
      I love the review! You are so right, Dorian Gray was a man who denied responsibility for everything and made himself worthless.I haven&apos;t read anything else by Oscar Wilde, but I&apos;m curious to see your opinion on some of his other works.
    
  
        
      Thanks, Catherine and Sabrina. It was a hard review to write. I had to sort through a lot of what was said that meant nothing, and decipher what the meaning was for myself. I think I&apos;ll probably reread it, at some point. It&apos;s kind of deep book.Catherine, I&apos;m going to read The Canterville Ghost this month. It&apos;s only about 26 pages. I&apos;ll review that one too.
    
  
        
      This was one of the those books that is so dark but it stays with you forever. If you read anything else by Wilde I would love to know what you think. What other book would you suggest?
    
  
        
      Katherine, this was my first by him. He has some fairy tales. I&apos;d like to read those too.
    
  
        
      What a great review Danielle.I really felt that you touched on all of the main points of the story.It&apos;s a wonderful book and I am with you.I couldn&apos;t feel sorry for him.He was such a selfish and vile person.
    
  
        
      Amazing review, Danielle! I&apos;ve not read the book, but recently saw the movie. After this review, I MUST read the book.
    
  
        
      Beautiful review, D!
    
  
        
      Brilliant review. ^^
    
  
        
      This was a pleasure to read Danielle!
    
  
        
      Thanks, Jeannie, Dhestiny, Kim, Melissa, and Gokce!
    
  
        
      Absolutely Beautiful Review Danielle, alot of food for thought. I think it&apos;s great and sometimes even worse when an author leaves the horror parts off screen and leaves it to the reader&apos;s imagination, cause you wonder &quot;just what did they really do&quot;
    
  
        
      Thanks, Rane. :) I agree with you. I think the imagination is a lot worse than what you can be told happened.
    
  
        
      I read this a long time ago but still remember it. The movie from the 1940s? was just so-so, the book was much better.
    
  
        
      Great review, Danielle :)This was Wilde&apos;s only novel, but what a goodie! You should definately read his short stories, they are also very thought-provoking.Still can&apos;t believe this book was banned and landed poor Oscar in jail!

      Thanks, Squarekitty. I think it showed a lot of hypocrisy in society that the powers that be didn&apos;t want to be seen.
    
  
        
      Fabulous review/discussion. I really enjoyed this book...I need to read it again. :)
    
  
        
      Thanks, Chris. :)
    
  
        
      Catherine wrote - Did it really? What was the reason?Because of the whole &apos;gay&apos; slant the book has and that Oscar was gay, so in that time/sociey that was a reason to ban the book for years &amp; chuck poor old Oscar in the slammer. Dorian is quite &apos;depraved&apos; and experimented in lots of different things, so Oscar included this (homosexuality) as well.Yes Danielle, was a time of hypocrisy - oh wait, has that really changed?? lol!
    
  
        
      Oh! *head slap* Of course that would do it! I didn&apos;t even consider that angle being the reason. Thanks for taking the time to explain it!
    
  
        
      &quot;I think this is a thinking person&apos;s horror novel.&quot;You are SPOT ON. I&apos;m 87% into the book, and all I want to do is look away. I consider it a beautifully composed train wreck, but not one where I can&apos;t help but stand and stare. Instead, I just want to turn around and not see the destruction. It&apos;s terrifying and terrible and tragic. I&apos;m not into horror as a genre, and this one has been a pretty horrifying read for me.
    
  
        
      Audrey, it&apos;s definitely not a comfortable read. Dorian Gray is a study in wasted potential, and in a very malignant way. I can identify with your discomfort. I felt that way, especially towards the end.
    
  
        
      I just finished it and wrote my review. I was torn and ended up giving it a 3 because I just couldn&apos;t say &quot;I really liked it!&quot; or &quot;I loved it!&quot; if I could barely stomach the feeling I had throughout the book. I gave it a 3 in recognition of Wilde&apos;s craftsmanship of a horrific tale.
    
  
        
      Your review is very eloquent. You are right about it being a train wreck!
    
  
        
      And you are so right - such wasted potential! Argh.
    
  
        
      The beauty of art is that it brings different emotions to different people, depending on their background and personal experiences. In this case I agree with yours and cannot put it in a better way. Excellent review and analysis of the book!
    
  
        
      Thank you, Renata!
    
  
        
      A hauntingly beautiful review. I&apos;ve pondered for many years over the decision of reading this book, but now I realize, I must read this book, at least once. Thank you, Danielle, especially for the words about arts reflecting the viewers, about everyone reading the same story but taking different lessons from it... These are known words, but contained within your review, they became something more.
    
  
        
      Great review. Love the description of Dorian as an &apos;angelically beautiful monster&apos;.
    
  
        
      Thanks for your comments, albeit belatedly, Sarina. I love the subjective nature of art and literature.
    
  
        
      Thank you, Sarah.
    
  
        
      :D You&apos;re welcome, as always, Danielle.
    
  
        
      very nice review there, I haven&apos;t started reading te book and had watched the movie countless of times, and yet when I read this review it seems that there wasn&apos;t anything lacking between the book and the film. of course in the film Dorian&apos;s debauchery was visualised, but in the review you made you mentioned in the book Wilde didn&apos;t supply evidence of his debauchery binge.five star on your review! I&apos;m getting interested in reading it.
    
  
        
      &quot; If anything really bothers me as a person, it&apos;s the thought of my time on this earth being wasted. Never having accomplished anything of value. For that reason, I found Dorian Gray to be a very sad man, but I could not feel sorry for him.&quot;I believe a person&apos;s fear says much about him , i have to agree that this is one of the top things worth worrying about in life .
    
  
        
      thinking person&apos;s horror novel...I like that.
    
  
        
      Great review! I especially liked the way you described Dorian Gray&apos;s character near the end--an angelically beautiful monster. That description is so fitting yet also scary, as Dorian&apos;s inner self was in total contrast to Dorian&apos;s attractive exterior. And you were so right in saying that Dorian led an empty life. I agree 100%, as Dorian stocked up on riches and wealth and invested everything in good looks as opposed to stocking up on character, morals and integrity and investing everything in living righteously and productively. Again, great review!
    
  
        
      I love that review Danielle! especially... &quot;Never having accomplished anything of value.&quot; what is it for you? which kind of value? if it is too personally I understand, but I would love to here from you. thanks.
    
  
        
      Gorgeous review, Danielle!

           The book starts off with this epigraph from the Erudite faction manifesto:&quot;Every question that can be answered must be answered or at least engaged. Illogical thought processes must be challenged when they arise.&quot;And then fantastically misses the mark. Allegiant was so chock full of plot holes, unrealistic situations, contrived character &quot;development&quot;, laughable explanations, and a whole load of &quot;wtf&quot; moments. And that&apos;s not even including the disastrous ending of this book. How this book managed to have an epigraph about being logical is a complete mystery to me. 
  ****INCLUDES MASSIVE SPOILERS****
(view spoiler)[Right from the get-go, the book wastes little time with the petty conflict between the factions and the factionless. The narrative spends a few convenient moments agonizing over the factionless vs. factions dilemma and then decides to venture outside the fence. Which, you know, is totally fine because we all assumed that at some point the narrative would come back to resolve that conflict in a reasonable way later on.  One dead character and a relatively easy stroll through the fence later, Tris and company encounter THE WORLD OUTSIDE THE FENCE. Behold, the moment we have all been waiting for. As it turns out, the world has apparently been so full of assholes that the government decided to eliminate the genes in citizens that caused dishonestly, selfishness, cowardice, stupidity, and aggression. Unfortunately, this backfired and just created more assholes that were more asshole-y than before. So how does a rational government fix this problem? Easy! Just construct gigantic city-sized behavioural experiments all across the country! Get volunteers who had their genes screwed with to have their memories wiped and stick them into a city and force them to choose a faction. Eventually these people will reproduce enough times until they finally manage to have &quot;genetically pure&quot; (a.k.a. Divergent) babies that are free from messed up genes. I mean, duh. That&apos;s, like, the most logical thing ever. Because its not like bad genes pass down bad genes or anything! Silly science! In fact, this department is just so full of geniuses that they decided that instead of using the genetic engineering prowess they already had to modify the genes of the genetically damaged offspring, they were just gonna wait around for 8 generations until the problem just miraculously fixed itself.  Don&apos;t worry. Their efforts aren&apos;t wasted. I&apos;ve already nominated them for the Nobel Prize in What-The-Fuckery. From then on, the book actually gets worse. Instead of trying to resolve the old conflict between the factionless and the factions, the book tries to take on a whole new conflict between the genetically pure and the genetically damaged, making the plot unnecessarily convoluted and leaving little to no room for proper character development. Tris and Four&apos;s switching POVs only disorient the reader further because as the book continues, the characters voices lose their distinctions and start to sound more and more like each other. While Tris may have been tougher in this book than in Insurgent (which is literally the only redeeming quality I&apos;m willing to give this book), Four&apos;s character gets a complete top-to-bottom deconstruction. Gone is the tough, strong, badass we got to know in the previous two books. Instead, Roth replaces Four with a bumbling emotional man child who fails to make rational decisions and think straight. His judgement is often clouded by his own insecurities and growing fears. Before we knew Four as being a character who would never let his fears control him. In Allegiant, Four&apos;s fears have his neck in a leash and tug him in any which direction and he willing goes without even putting up a fight.Which now brings me to the disastrous ending of this book. Suddenly, tensions are rising between the factionless and the Allegiant (the group who wants to re-establish the faction system) and Evelyn decides she&apos;s going to use the Erudite death serum to wipe out her opponents. But the Department of Genetic Welfare is having none of her shit so they decide that they&apos;re just going to wipe out everyone&apos;s memory so they don&apos;t kill each other. (Can I also point out here that they used this memory-wiping serum before to trick the general population into thinking that the genetically damaged are alone the cause of the world&apos;s problems? So you know, there wouldn&apos;t be massive protests or anything when the government decided to deliberately waste money trying to solve a problem they knew was fucked to begin with.)A race against the clock ensues where Four goes back to Chicago to try and wipe the memories of his parents to stop them from fighting while Tris stays behind to try and steal this memory serum and use it on the Department themselves. The book gets a little preachy right before this part where the characters start talking about how erasing someone&apos;s memories is inherently evil---unless you have good intentions, of course. The Department also has good intentions for using this serum on Chicago and saving the lives of thousands of people, but fuck logic. Our heroes would way rather just watch the people they love kill each other.  And how exactly does the book wrap up the supposedly exciting and suspenseful conflict between the factionless and the Allegiant that has brewing in the background this whole time? Easy! Just have a nice Eaton family reunion where Evelyn magically just decides that the years she&apos;s spent neglecting her son and fighting for her own idea of justice is utterly useless because she&apos;s been transformed by *~The Power of Love~*. No need to rip apart all of Chicago like she&apos;s been planning to her whole life. All she needs is her son.  A few supporting characters die in the book, but you don&apos;t really care. If the author didn&apos;t bother spending enough time developing that character, why should readers even flinch when they drop dead? Of course, the book makes these deaths a big deal but you&apos;re sitting there like Back in at the Department of Genetic Welfare, Caleb is picked for the suicide mission of breaking into the top-security vault to steal the memory-wiping serum. This is only fitting as Caleb is literally the only character who needs to be redeemed for his betrayal in Insurgent. I mean, the tagline of the book is &quot;one choice can define you&quot; so if Caleb doesn&apos;t own up to this moment he&apos;s basically going to be a selfish, heartless, coward for the rest of the story.Oh wait. This book hasn&apos;t sufficiently fucked up already so instead of using a perfectly good opportunity for a back-stabbing character to redeem themselves, it&apos;s just going to unnecessarily sacrifice the freaking main character because life is cruel and heartless goddammit!  I could literally write another essay on why this particular ending sucked balls, but before some anon messages me saying &quot;omgg it&apos;s veronica&apos;s book and her ending was so tragic but so byootiful don&apos;t you know you&apos;re not allowed to hate it??!111&quot; let me explain myself. I have no problem with happy endings, bittersweet endings, sad endings, or even unresolved endings AS LONG AS THE ENDING MAKES SENSE WITH THE BODY OF THE WORK. This is literally all I ask of any author of any novel. From just a character perspective, it makes sense that Tris would sacrifice herself for the greater good. That&apos;s just what she, as a selflessly reckless person, would do. But considering that there was a perfectly good person involved in this ending that needed to be redeemed (*cough Caleb cough*) who didn&apos;t offer to sacrifice himself to save his sister, I&apos;m questioning the true motive for why this ending was picked. We already know that Tris is a character who&apos;s willing to sacrifice herself for the greater good. Did we learn any new information about her character when she decided to make this sacrifice? Wouldn&apos;t we have gained a better perspective of Caleb if he had made this choice instead? And most importantly, wouldn&apos;t sparing Tris&apos;s life allow the final conclusion of this trilogy to be more sound, less rushed, and less overshadowed by the her death? Tris&apos;s sacrifice comes off as being meaningless because she doesn&apos;t save anyone from dying. Had she failed to using the memory serum, the worst thing that would have happened was that Chicago would have been reset and the main conflict would have disappeared completely. And that doesn&apos;t even matter in the end because all the major characters that we are supposed to care about were already inoculated against the memory serum anyway. In fact, by stealing the memory serum, Tris effectively tosses up the fate of Chicago in the air. If Four hadn&apos;t *~magically~* convinced his mother to stop fighting then the city would have been in shreds and more people would have died. The careless way her death is written and revealed makes the ending look like it was purely written simply for a cheap shock value. Cue the forced emotional and dramatic ending where readers drown in a puddle of their feels as we&apos;re forced to read Four&apos;s tragic reaction to her death. The last few chapters, including the epilogue, are incredibly rushed. Literally every single issue in the growing mountain of problems that accumulated over the course of this book are immediately solved without any further complications or commentary because deus ex machina. EDIT (7/11/13): The ending is far from being the worst thing about this book, but I did read the author&apos;s blog post about what she was aiming for. Keeping her intentions in mind, I still think this ending failed in it&apos;s execution. Primarily, the inorganic way that the events are revealed crushes the effect this ending was trying to achieve. EDIT (9/11/13): Another blatant plot hole I&apos;m baffled over: Tris discovers that her mother was brought in from the outside to rescue Divergents who were being killed by Jeanine&apos;s predecessor. Then later on, it is revealed that the Bureau supplied Jeanine with the attack simulation serum she used to massacre the Abnegation. So the Bureau is apparently so cautious and protective of every Divergent life that they are willing to send in one of their own to save as many of them as possible, but helping Jeanine massacre an entire faction that contains Divergents is totally ok with them? Why is this link between the Bureau and Jeanine established but never explained at length? Did it show us anything other than the fact that this book is riddled with more plot holes?  (hide spoiler)]2/10would not recommend 
         
        
      loooolll yeah, the Tris dying for Caleb thing....like just imagine how lame it would be if Harry died for Peter Pettigrew- oh, but wait, he would never, because ass holes like that have it coming, sorry not sorry.
    
  
        
      you put everything I thought I about this book and more. Roth did nothing new here really, despite her effort to do so. It&apos;s all YA tropes that has been done before by JK Rowling and Suzanne Collins. The difference is they did it better, while Roth fell flat. Tris&apos; fate was nothing but for shock value, and any author who resorts to shock value while sacrificing the integrity of their characters (no matter how blandly written and annoying the character is) is a hack.and don&apos;t even get me started with the plotholes from the very first chapter and the moment Tobias&apos; started narrating, ugh.
    
  
        
      perfect review, you wrote my thoughts exactly!
    
  
        
      Thank you so much for your comments guys! I keep getting surprised by the number of people who actually bothered to read this ridiculous long and barely coherent rant XD Emily wrote: &quot;...just imagine how lame it would be if Harry died for Peter Pettigrew&quot;It&apos;s funny that you brought up HP because I was literally just thinking about how Roth was aiming for this ending to be as dramatic as the way Harry sacrificed himself at the end of Deathly Hallows--except that her story lacks the development it needed for this kind of ending to be effective. Marianne wrote: &quot;Tris&apos; fate was nothing but for shock value, and any author who resorts to shock value while sacrificing the integrity of their characters (no matter how blandly written and annoying the character is) is a hack.&quot;Took the words out of my mouth! (view spoiler)[I think there is an unspoken rule about main characters where authors will not kill them off unless it is absolutely necessary and is the only logical solution to the story. There&apos;s a reason why it&apos;s very rarely seen in fiction: because it requires a certain skill and style to pull off. Killing off Tris, imo, was a betrayal of the entire story. This kind of character death should never be done for superficial reasons. Tbh, I would have been more merciful about this ending had her death been dealt with a little more grace and taste. But Tris is discarded like she&apos;s a supporting character.  (hide spoiler)]
    
  
        
      Perfect review. Gives me some peace that I&apos;m not the only one.
    
  
        
      amen! great review.. i thought this point was especiallay poignant: &quot;I have no problem with happy endings, bittersweet endings, sad endings, or ever unresolved endings AS LONG AS THE ENDING MAKES SENSE WITH THE BODY OF THE WORK&quot;. i had a similar thought in my review, but you said it much more eloquently. thank you!
    
  
        
      With Allegiant, I could literally feel Roth trying to set herself and her series apart from Hunger Games, Harry Potter, and other books out there. She thought, “How do I make this different? How will everyone remember this, forever?” But in her attempt to set herself apart from her genre, she deviated from it completely. She ruined the simplicity, intensity, and the genius behind her original book.Look, when I sit down to read a John Green novel, I expect loss and separation. But the Divergent series was always about much more than that. It was about choices; how they effect you, and how you grow and learn from them. How after all the pain and misery of life, war, and loss, you can still rebuild. Allegiant however, lacked this growth. The alternative point of views resulted in flat characters with little character development. There was little to no plot, and the plot that manifested felt forced and vague. With Allegiant, I was doing what I have never done before- I was reading for the ending. I was waiting, hoping, that maybe the mediocrity would be worth it because of some divine and intense conclusion. I don’t even want to get into the ending, but I will say, that it felt unnecessary. The event itself is not what I despise, it is the manner in which it happened. It was the events leading up to it, and the events proceeding. It was the fact that it didn’t make sense, there were so many other alternative solutions. “The meaning of a sacrifice lies in its necessity,” Tobias said, and I think Roth disregarded her own words.I want so badly for the leak to be fake, but that would only be wishful thinking, synonymous to Tris hoping her mother was at the bureau. The writing did not feel like the same author as the first two novels. It was poorly written and poorly paced. Also, the great “what is behind the fence” and the “purity war” was a grievous disappointment. In all honesty, I felt like Roth did not know how to end something that she started.
    
  
        
      I&apos;ll just consider this review as being one of the best things that came out of how absolutely terrible Allegiant was :D
    
  
        
      can we please talk about how david practically got away with murder?

      I agree with this review completely. This book lost all its coherency because it wanted to do TOO MUCH and ended up doing nothing at all. What bugs me the most is that they completely ignore what had made Tris &quot;so special&quot; to begin with. All the mythical powers of the Divergent is completely hand waved. Tris survives a toxic death serum and it&apos;s basically like &quot;yeah, cool, whatever.&quot; What kind of scientific research are they even doing?
    
  
        
      THANK YOU for the review...you took the words right away from my mouth!what bothers me the most was how excited i was about this book after insurgent which was really good and it was such an epic let-down!
    
  
        
      I love your review and totally agree with it. Resumes perfect this book, which for me was a huge disappointment.
    
  
        
      I soooo agree you you.
    
  
        
      Thank you so much for your reviw! I have decided not to read this book, as muchas I was anticipating it, I&apos;m just not up for the heartbreak and the anger is going to bring :(.
    
  
        
      Wonderful review!
    
  
        
      Could not agree more.
    
  
        
      Agree completely. The whole thing was a disappointment.
    
  
        
      What. the hell. This will not be read. WHAT IS THIS?I always thought Roth wrote herself into a corner with Insurgent. I gave her the benefit of the doubt until Allegiant came out, thinking she might be able to figure a way out of it. Sounds like she did not. This book looks like it reads like fanfiction
    
  
        
      These are basically my exact feelings, down to the simmering frustration and anger I sense underneath all the well expressed and reasoned criticisms.
    
  
        
      Agreed!
    
  
        
      what a let down and waste! Excellent review! I am so disappointed

This book lost all its coherency because it wanted to do TOO MUCH and ended up doing nothing at all.&quot;Perfectly sums up another important point!The book already had a complicated conflict between the factionless and the factions. If that conflict was not going to be adequately dealt with in this book, it should have been dropped entirely from the end of Insurgent. Or, the whole GD vs. GP thing should have been more brief. There was really no need to drag that out with a terrorist plot and annoying scenes in the fringes where we&apos;re demanded to feel sorry for these characters. Prejudice exists. We get it already. Why do we have to be hit over the head with it multiple times? Abagail wrote: &quot;What bugs me the most is that they completely ignore what had made Tris &quot;so special&quot; to begin with. All the mythical powers of the Divergent is completely hand waved. &quot;This is incredibly annoying. Especially since the crux of Divergent and Insurgent seemed to be ebbing at this question: what exactly is &quot;divergent&quot;? what causes it? and why is it so special in this world? Only to have those questions trivialized with a lazy answer and treated as if it wasn&apos;t even an important part of the series to begin with. It&apos;s almost as if the whole &quot;divergent&quot; thing was contrived to lead up the differences between the GP and GD.
    
  
        
      What I hate about the GP and GD thing is that being Divergent&apos;s no longer about being different or special and it turned out to be something related with genetics... like wtf? I expected more.
    
  
        
      Thanks for this review!
    
  
        
      ok, guess I will NOT be reading this thanks to the ending. thanks for spoiling it I wanted to know.
    
  
        
      Iam convinced that the only people who will think this book is &quot;good&quot; are people who don&apos;t normally read! Your review is spot on!!
    
  
        
      Yes, exactly. Thank you.
    
  
        
      thank you! actually, those are the same issues I found in Insurgent. I&apos;m never going to pick this one up.
    
  
        
      Terrific review and I got such a laugh out of the skeleton! I suspect the only way Lionsgate Films is going to be able to make any money on their upcoming Divergent movie is if they promise to completely change the plot in the next couple of films to fix the mess Roth made.
    
  
        
      PS To read a rare tragic ending done perfectly, try Tolstoy&apos;s Anna Karenina (I recommend the translation by Pevear and Volokhonsky).
    
  
        
      OMG this review is PERFECTION! I feel like Veronica Roth did such an injustice to her main characters and killed off Tris strictly for shock value. I feel like after Tris sacrificed herself the rest of the book was just blubbering words. I hated Allegiant so much that I almost wish I never read the series.
    
  
        
      You took the words from my mouth... tris wanted to live after everything in insurgent... then why????? Why couldnt she have just attacked david or something...he was injured for gods sake! This whole series is ruined for me. ..I recommended it to a friend n she was going to read it but I dont kniw if I want to let her experience the awesome 1st book and then this horrible ending...
    
  
        
      I think you summed up every feeling I had for this book. I was so utterly disappointed. Especially in Four&apos;s character!! I can&apos;t believe how whiny and emotional he was in this book compared to the others.
    
  
        
      exactly how i thought.this sucked.
    
  
        
      totally agree. I can&apos;t express how disappointed I am. :(
    
  
        
      Thanks for your review. I just finished the book a few Minutes ago and I am still trying to get over the shock value of killing off Tris. Heck, he would think with a YA fiction giant like this, she could have taken a little more care in ending it. Sadly, these are characters that readers have come to know, love and respect, and, for me, when she killed Tris off--she may as well have said &quot;Tris dies. The end.&quot; Everything after that was pretty meaningless to me. Ugh.
    
  
        
      This is exactly what I&apos;ve been raging about but couldn&apos;t put into words. I am so disappointed. I feel duped. Nothing worked. I was eye rolling from the first few chapters. I am in awe right now. I honestly don&apos;t understand how this book can be rationally defended by anyone other than the people who are just &quot;oh my feels!!&quot; which really just cheapens the entire trilogy altogether.
    
  
        
      My thoughts exactly. And to top it off, we get a lot of the plot and character motivations constantly told to us rather than shown. The whole book read like one giant info dump with some &quot;ill advised&quot; YA tropes thrown in to up the angst. The strong point of this series was its original premise... The factions in this strange dystopian Chicago. Without it, the characters fall flat. It&apos;s almost funny to see the characters reactions to the huge size of the world and the resulting feelings of insignificance it inspired, since the series itself suffers from the same thing. By taking the characters out of their original environment, not only do we find ourselves in a world that we care very little but it also takes away the significance of the characters and their actions prior to leaving. /sigh
    
  
        
      This review is spot on! I didn&apos;t even cry or feel sad because I was so pissed for all the reasons you&apos;ve explained. I can&apos;t remember the last time I was this disappointed in a book.
    
  
        
      Thanks for this review. Like almost all of the other commenters, I completely agree with you. I&apos;m so disappointed.
    
  
        
      You saved me 10 euro and 15 hours or so reading time. Thank you!
    
  
        
      Your review reflects pretty accurately my view of the book. For me however the worst aspect of the story was the missing explanation of Tris&apos; &apos;special powers&apos;. None of the other &apos;divergents&apos; or &apos;genetically pure&apos; were able to resist truth- and death-serums (as far as we know). So why could she? I mean: WTF?? It just makes no sense to me. If it was an evolutionary genetic thing wouldn&apos;t other divergents have shown similar powers?
    
  
        
      Agree completely. What a ham fisted move by Roth, killing off Tris. It seemed to me she just wanted to set herself apart, and it came across as a worthless sacrifice. All I could think when I finished the book was WTF and &apos;betrayal&apos;! I felt completely betrayed and immediately deleted the whole series off my ipad.
    
  
        
      Great review! It really did sum up my thoughts perfectly. I am so disappointed after reading this book, that it&apos;s therapeutic to read through your review and all of the other readers&apos; comments. Thank you!
    
  
        
      Loved your review. You got it right on all counts. What a sucky ending to the series. Now go watch the movie?! I don&apos;t think so.
    
  
        
      I&apos;m wondering if they are going to change the ending for the movies. I can&apos;t imagine them, if they film all three, having it end like this crap book.
    
  
        
      THANK YOU! This review really helped me process my feelings. Before I read this I was a giant squid of anger with a touch of confused sorrow. After waiting for this book to come out for a year and a half I was expecting so much more. I felt cheated when I ended the book. I put so much into this series and now it is unreadable because of this last installment. I hate being disappointed, and this book was a hard blow for me to take.
    
  
        
      Amazing review!!
    
  
        
      The exact feeling I felt about everything! The ending makes zero sense and I don&apos;t see why she even bothered to put Tori and George&apos;s relationship. It&apos;s not like she used it in some way on the story.

           I may never be happy ever again.The fun and laughter is over. I have finally read Allegiant, and I feel empty inside. Empty but accepting, and understanding.This book makes Mockingjay feel like Dr Seuss. I had a few problems with it (mainly that it spelled out a bit too much for the reader, lacked finesse with the handling of themes, and was sometimes pretty predictable) but the character development was breathtaking, the plot was heart-pounding and since it&apos;s a young adult novel, I think Veronica Roth did a pretty damn decent job:)Most readers are going to love it.You know what? Who gives a shit about the technicalities.  We&apos;re all here crying (read: sobbing our eye sockets dry) because of that ending. Veronica whispered threats into my ear, aimed a gun at my head, looked away for a moment to lull me into a false sense of security before SHOOTING MY PUPPY IN THE FACE. (this is basically me throughout the last half of the book)Don&apos;t misunderstand, this book was great! READ IT NOW. But it&apos;s like half of me wants to worship this majestic object and the other half wants to 
  fling the beast into the faces of my enemies.
Just like the characters in the book, the grief wipes away any deep philosophical mulling I might have about what happened in the plot. All that matters is the grief and the death in the end. Veronica makes that point pretty damn clear. War is never romantic. Period.Hell, the lesson I&apos;ve learnt from 1984, V for Vendetta, Hunger Games and Divergent? Romance and anarchy do NOT MIX, 0/10, WOULD NOT RECOMMEND. Going against your government? STEEL YOUR HEART AND VAGINA GIRL, TOO DAMN BAD. Because the subsequent grief... man. I&apos;m still crying.To all those currently reading the book, see you in hell, comrades. And to those crying and limp on their beds now, welcome my friends. This part is for those who have read the book. I disagree with a hell lot of complaints made about this book, and this is why:(view spoiler)[ Okay, straight up, I know most of us are upset (read: brutally slaughtered) by the character death at the end. However, I don&apos;t think that just because we hate the death doesn&apos;t mean that this book &quot;totally sucks&quot;. Veronica Roth, unfortunately, does not owe us a HEA. I&apos;m perfectly fine crying on my bed yelling &quot;you HORRIBLE HORRIBLE WOMAN YOU RIPPED MY HEART OUT HOW COULD YOU&quot; while sobbing into my pillow, but inside, I&apos;m able to distance myself from my personal bias and see what this book is trying to say. Because of this, I just want to put my thoughts out there about what some people are saying.The genetic project that created the genetically damaged people is legitimateA dystopia is the complete opposite of a utopia, which is a perfect society. More fundamentally, dystopias form as a result of utopian societies gone wrong.Looking at our world right now, it&apos;s easy to see the flaws in people. We look at the government and see selfishness. We look at people around us and see pride. In fact, everywhere we look, we see the flaws in humanity. And most of us are not at peace with it. During the American government shut down of 2013, the approval ratings for the republicans was an astoundingly bad 12%. We as a society see that selfishness, that irrationality and pride and it makes us angry. 47% of people said that congress would be better off if nearly every member was replaced. This is our real life response.It is not difficult to see a society dedicated to getting rid of these traits. In fact, it&apos;s shockingly, astounding easy to. That&apos;s Veronica&apos;s point. That&apos;s her utopia going bad. The failure of the genetic experiment is her commentary on human beings non acceptance of human nature. We do not accept selfishness, stupidity, pride, as part of us. We want to get rid of it. We vilify it. And when faced with the chance to be rid of it, we would probably take it.And by essentially playing God, in our rejection of the darkness in each and every one of us, we created bigger monsters.The forming of the factions were a perfectly valid solution to the problem caused by the genetically damaged.This is absolutely crucial to understand. &quot;This doesn&apos;t solve the problem at all! Doesn&apos;t it just breed MORE genetically damaged individuals? It doesn&apos;t make any sense!&quot;This train of thought is exactly Veronica&apos;s intention. Put yourself in the shoes of one of those who were not genetically damaged. Who were still perfectly imperfect. The government is going to close off those twisted human beings and basically breed them in large labs, letting them multiply?Why not just kill them all?After all, they aren&apos;t actually human. They aren&apos;t God&apos;s intention. They are unnatural. Inhuman. Man-made.Or are they?As a result of human&apos;s tampering, human beings have have created unnatural versions of themselves. The reason why the genetically damaged are prejudiced against and disadvantaged in this society is because they are regarded as less human. All those people in those factions, in the eyes of everyone else who knows of their unnatural state, are considered nothing more than experiments gone wrong to so many.The Civil Wars were to eradicate the experiments.However, human beings have a conscience. Most of us know, deep down, that the genetically altered deserve a chance to make their own choices. Society had made a mistake in playing god once, and suffered horribly for it.Society would not make the same mistake again. The American Government in Allegiant would not make two wrongs in hopes of getting a right. And eradicating an entire generation of living breathing beings is most certainly playing god, and most certainly on par as wrong.And if they could not kill the genetically damaged, they sure as hell would try and find a way where the genetically damaged could survive, thrive and find their own humanity. These subsequent projects involving factions were society&apos;s grappling apology. They are trying to fix what they have done. You do not get to erase the past. Correlating with this thread, society would NOT try and correct these genes again. Firstly, you cannot CREATE genes when they have been removed. Secondly, to alter the genes AGAIN would be playing god, would be being foolish. Why would a society which has already suffered the repercussions of playing god repeat the exact same thing again? And if they could not fix them, and they could not kill them, what other choice did they have?This entire book revolves around the question on whether the gentically damaged were less human, and it left YOU to decide for yourself.How could they expect the genetically damaged to just fix themselves by creating random divergents?This concept is more difficult to grasp because it requires knowledge in biology. Populations can fix themselves as a result of natural selection and selective pressure.Basically, the genetically damaged are less likely to survive, while the divergent are more likely too. As a result, the divergents would be more likely to survive into adulthood, reproduce and eventually there will be a larger proportion of divergents as compared to the others. The Divergent themselves crop up as a result of genetic mutation or genetic healing. Your genes can change. The world didn&apos;t start with one basic template for every trait that ever existed. The different hair colors, different physical traits today more likely began as mutations and then thrived under natural selection and selective pressure.This should have been explained better in the book, absolutely.The whole shebang with the memory serum raises a hell lot of important questions and are not supposed to be a pretty solution wrapped in a silk bow.The conflict Tris faced with the morality of the memory serum is real. Is it right to remove one&apos;s memory? Removing one&apos;s memory brings with it dozens of ethical issues. Does it remove Free Will? Are the memory-altered the same people as they were before then? Can you convict a person who has done a crime even if they don&apos;t remember what they have done? Who has the right to alter someone&apos;s memory? Is it playing God? Has technology gone to far today, and should society limit what it could do? Do the ends justify the means? And does the &quot;Greater Good&quot; even exist, or are things either just right or wrong? These questions are for all of us to think about. It&apos;s not just a problem-solution thing here guys. We cannot look at it simply, or we&apos;ll be missing the point completely. It&apos;s not about leaving them to kill themselves: It&apos;s about giving them a choice to make their own mistakes and staying true to who they are. Personally I don&apos;t feel like Veronica Roth handled these themes with as much finesse as I would like, but for a YA novel I&apos;ll let it go.Evelyn&apos;s decision to choose her son over everything she&apos;s worked for was monumental.Again, if you look at it simply, you will not see what is trying to be said. For me, I think Veronica is trying to show you the power of maternal love (a very strong theme in Harry Potter as well), the complexity of humanity, the ability to change your decisions and actions, the effect of abuse and how the abusee can turn into the abuser, and finally the sharp contrast between Evelyn and Marcus.Both Evelyn and Marcus are genetically damaged people, aka deemed less human or inhuman altogether. For Marcus, he is the perfect example of how the genetic alteration experiment has created monsters. Marcus is twisted and rid of humanity. He, we can easily deem as inhuman. But one man&apos;s twisted character does not determine those of his kind. Evelyn is just as genetically altered, and yet she overcame her genetic deficiencies. She made herself. Her genes did not determine her actions despite the fact that she was designed and made that way. Her decision to choose her son was not simply a cheesy act of love. It was an epic bitchslap to her genetic makeup. Evelyn defied her supposed destiny and carved out another on her own.(Actually, I was pointed out in the comments that Marcus was Divergent, something I completely forgot! That just draws an even sharper contrast between Evelyn and Marcus which better questions just how much control our genetic makeup has over our actions. Evelyn, despite being inherently inhuman, was indefinitely more human than Marcus, who was altogether healed. This just shows us how evil can exist in any of us, just as good can.)This raises one more big question. Is Caleb&apos;s betrayal justified because he was genetically altered? Are any of the actions of the genetically altered justified? Or were they just as much their choices instead of simply their genetic code?More questions.And finally, Tris&apos; death. Hell on roller skates, mop my tears for a sec.To be honest, I don&apos;t want to ponder too much about her death because its purpose feels highly subjective to everyone&apos;s personal interpretation to me. However, I feel like it was right that she died as who she was and not a shadow of herself. Tris&apos; ultimate sacrifice for love and the greater good was who she is. If we were to have our Happily Ever After, we would have with us a false caricature of Tris. This is who she is, and we cannot deny our loved ones their own choices and their very nature.I felt that her seeing her mother at the very end was absolutely beautiful, and negates any argument that says that she died meaninglessly. She died still swinging and living life true to who she is, and she reunited with her loved ones. Hell, this means she probably reunited with Uriah too in the end, and that makes me cry all the more harder.Well these are my thoughts, feel free to comment below on your own!

      i even reread divergent and insurgent the day before for this. I&apos;m heartbroken and fighting tears. Thanks Veronica Roth for ruining my life! Why, just why? They deserved to live happily ever after! Tris&apos; last words are &apos;i love you&apos; but just before she was imagining a simple life with Four....I hate you Veronica. I cant read anything and i probably wont be able to. Thanks to you I will probably also not be in a state to read the fiery heart when it comes out next month. I&apos;m so lost.
    
  
        
      Best description ever of Allegiant. I don&apos;t know what to think right now. sigh.
    
  
        
      excellent review, captured everything i felt!
    
  
        
      this book ruined my emotional stability. :( I thought they were going to have their HEA since there&apos;s alot that had been sacrificed and they deserve to be happy. to be together :&quot;(oh hell i think i&apos;m gonna be having trust issues from now own.
    
  
        
      Song for Allegiant:All I wanted was to read this book and all it did was Wreeeeck meeee! yah it wreckkeddd meeeeee
    
  
        
      im devastated after reading the book...
    
  
        
      I can&apos;t even think straight at this point. Like the world is moving too fast and I&apos;m stuck in this emotionally compromised limbo.
    
  
        
      I. CAN&apos;T. EVEN. I... I don&apos;t know what to do. I&apos;ve been crying for oven half an hour, and I can&apos;t stop crying.
    
  
        
      I need a support group to put my life back together after this book..
    
  
        
      Chanel wrote: &quot;I need a support group to put my life back together after this book..&quot;haha I feel you girl! I think I need one too!
    
  
        
      okay you guys are scaring me i get my book tomorrow im reading some of tou guys comments and i have that feeling like when you feel right before you drop from a rollercoaster uhh i need to read the book now!!!!! i need to know what happens to four and tris!!!
    
  
        
      that ending ruined me. it was so hard to finish b/c i didn&apos;t want to believe it. i STILL don&apos;t want to believe it!! :&apos;(
    
  
        
      I know your pain, that ending just makes you feel empty inside but at the same time you accept it.
    
  
        
      Your review pretty much sums it up! *stands on the side of the room with the other sobbing people*
    
  
        
      I am still expecting a novella to be published saying that this damn ending is NOT TRUE b/c I can&apos;t even function right now. I&apos;m in the &quot;anger&quot; stage of grief since I just don&apos;t think it needed to end that way! I agree that Tris did die in the best possible way for her...but I think it was super unnecessary 
    
  
        
      I would say more about this perfect description of our feeling but I can&apos;t stop crying...
    
  
        
      I&apos;m not ashamed to say that I cried. Not when Tris saw her mother and etc., but when Cara tells Four. Because a small part of me still hoped that Tris would still be alive (although possibly &quot;damaged&quot; [sorry, pun not intended]).I feel empty and I feel emotionally drained.I couldn&apos;t function at work at all today, and I&apos;m not sure how to accept that ending. At all.I&apos;ve read very few books (Harry Potter[I was young, but whatever], The Hunger Games, The Maze Runner, The Heroes of Olympus, Eragon and A Song of Ice and Fire and Flashforward) that made me really emotional, but none so much as this one.And except from Flashforward, I&apos;ve never felt so lost at all. And FF gets me on my Thanatophobia (or a variation of it), but anyways... that was offtopic. :X
    
  
        
      Oh my gosh this is so fantastic. I could not agree more! Lol
    
  
        
      I just finished! I need a drink and a support group, and probably more tissues.

           Ten Hours later...When I don’t like a series ending, I tell myself it’s partially my own fault - that the book suffered from my expectations. In the case of Allegiant, I think it went a little beyond that. Hours after finishing and sleeping on my crushing disappointment, I have to admit that very little of this book worked for me. So I’m turning to the device that I always turn to when I’m stressed or overwhelmed with something: lists. As always in a review of this nature, there will be MASSIVE SPOILERS for all three books in this series. I’m using a cut, and it means very definite business.Things that Did not Work for Me in Allegiant, a List by Kate(view spoiler)[1. The World BuildingWhen you think about both Divergent and Insurgent, there was very little actual world building that went on. We established the faction system and the way it functions in Divergent. We also established the problems inherent with that system. In Insurgent, we explored those problems more by watching the breakdown. And then, in the end of Insurgent, we find out that it’s all an experiment intended to save the outside world from war and violence and poverty.Then, we get to Allegiant. Everything in the video is a lie (so, in a lot of ways, everything Tris did at the end of Insurgent was for nothing). The outside world is basically Chicago 2.0, only instead of being divided by personality type people are divided by the extent of their broken genes. It’s an interesting thought and a cool platform for philosophizing, but so much is crammed into this book that we don’t have time for those subtleties. Basically, we have one book to learn the mass of information we need to know about the outside.This info dump is compounded by several things: 1) Everything we thought we knew about the outside is a lie and some things we thought we knew about the people on the inside is a lie, too; 2) Tris knows nothing about the outside so things that we know about as readers keep being off-handedly explained to her and also not explained to her; 3) a lot of what Tris has to figure out is science and history, and there&apos;s not the sufficient background needed to help with suspension of disbelief.This is clearly supposed to be far into the future - at least seven generations? - but fundamentally it’s still the world we know. We knew that because of the fact that Chicago was clearly recognizable. But knowing that everything on the outside is basically still functioning through our government and that the same kinds of issues still cause problems? Something about that made me question every piece of information thrown at me.There was too much information introduced in this book for it to be the closing of a series and I honestly think this whole series would have benefited from a fourth book.2. Character Developmenta. The background charactersNone of the background characters went anywhere significant. I did not learn anything new about Cara, Christina, or Uriah. I could have eliminated all three of them from this book and everything would have been the same. Even Uriah’s injury and death felt like a plot point for Four that was ultimately completely glossed over. Peter and Caleb showed no growth or change. Peter proved that he is still the same coward he has always been (and yet somehow he gets exactly what he wants). Caleb, too, proved a coward. He was given the chance for redemption and he didn’t take it. As for Natalie Prior, I thought her backstory was interesting. It was one of the few interesting things about the book, though I thought the “love triangle” was unnecessary and slowed the plot down. I also couldn’t wrap my brain around why, when she found out Tris was divergent, she wouldn’t have told her at least some of this information she knew, something that would help her daughter and her society. And even though it was interesting backstory, it didn’t change Natalie Prior’s motivations for saving her daughter and acting as she did.There was a rash of seemingly senseless deaths in this book. First, Edward dies. But...why? To show that the factionless show as little regard for human life as the Erudite did? For the two page scene in which we don’t know if Evelyn is upset by his death? The same thing with Tori, who died, it seems, simply to provide the moment in which we find out how wrong she was and that her brother now has to deal with her death?But...why do I care about George Wu? This problem ties back to the world-building problem and the need for another book. We are introduced to so many new characters. Some lady whose name I can’t remember, Amar, George, Nita, Matthew, David, all the people from The Fringe. The people from the Fringe? We barely learn anything besides their names. Amar and George are there, it seems, to provide some familiarity for our refugees, but we barely see them and they don’t teach us anything new about the inside or the outside. Then we get to Nita, who plays a major role and then just seems to disappear. Matthew has a nice little speech about the Terrible thing that genetic prejudice caused to happen, but who is also basically a clone of Cara. And David, who is exactly, exactly like Jeanine. Having so many new people cut out our chance to see the people that mattered.Like...b. TrisTris came a long way in Insurgent and she learned a lot of things. I thought, overall, she was doing well and continuing that trend (until the end, which ruined everything). But here was my problem with Tris: besides what happened at the end, was she wrong about ANYTHING in this book? It’s like she could perfectly read every situation and every person, and she was kind of a condescending jerk about it. She wants to act like she’s never been wrong, but I remember her surprise at Caleb’s betrayal. I remember that it took a bit for her to figure out Evelyn was Four’s mother. I remember that she didn’t see Al’s betrayal coming, or even Eric’s. I remember that she didn’t see through Evelyn’s plan until it was already happening. Tris isn’t infallible, and I liked that about her. Those mistakes made Tris human. But in Allegiant? she’s suddenly perfect. She is smart and strong and skilled and canny and selfless to a ridiculous extent. It makes it hard for us to blame Tris when she’s annoyed that people are ignoring her or not trusting her gut. It also makes Four’s journey that much more difficult to handle, because knowing that she’s always right means that he’s always wrong. And he kind of is. c. FourI really wish we had not gotten Four’s point of view in this book. I’d say a big portion of the problems I had stemmed from the dual points of view. Fundamentally, we had to learn everything new through both characters because obviously they reacted differently to everything. This really slowed down the pacing and bogged this book down in repetitive backstory. His sections of the book were indistinguishable in both tone and voice. Though Tris and Four complimented each other so well in the first two books - made an excellent team of equals - they are also very different personality types. Sure, they have similar characteristics - the same kinds of things make them tick - but they go about things in a very different way.I’ll be honest. I didn&apos;t find Four likable in this book. I got flashes of the Four I loved, but he was so mired down in all of his weaknesses that reading his portions of the book was really hard. He is the one that was so mad at Tris in the last book for lying, and he is the one that told her at that he should trust her and not hide things from her. But, what happens? Four finds out that he’s not really divergent (um, ok?), and then he completely breaks down and immediately loses all the growth he’d accomplished in the first two books and does something stupid.Part of me understands that the point is that Four isn’t perfect; he has four fears, but those four fears are so much bigger and more terrifying than most people’s ten or twenty (or my thousand). He has Major Issues. However, I knew that about him already. We already watched this struggle with the need to do something to make the world better and also the need to protect Tris and be a good man in the face of incredibly difficult choices. We spent a book watching him deal with his feelings for his mother and father, even if we never watched him deal with those things from this point of view. It was wrenching, but it made him grow.This Four is broken. He has lost all of the defining elements that made him Four. He is weak and indecisive and insecure and, most surprisingly of all, irrational. His participation in Nita’s plan baffles me. Since when has Four ever blindly trusted anyone’s plan (or anyone, for that matter), let alone a stranger’s? Since when does he not at least argue with Tris OR ANYONE about the moral complications of what is happening? It’s one thing for him to go along with Evelyn’s plan (though even then only at first); that relationship and his feelings are complicated. Here, his decision makes no sense. He barely knows Nita. Why is he not working with Cara and Christina and Tris? Why is he not asking that they be involved? It made no sense to me, even in context of losing his identity.And then, his actions and his part in this plan are ignored? There are no consequences aside from the fact that Uriah is unconscious and ultimately dies. (That entire plot point just seemed pointless. Tris is going to be plenty mad about Four being so stupid already; Four is going to feel plenty guilty about acting like a completely naive hayseed without Uriah having to eat it). Then the issue became about Uriah instead of why on earth he made this ridiculous decision and what he was feeling. After this incredibly boneheaded and uncharacteristic decision? I don’t even know what the hell to make of what was going on with Four. I did not understand his motivations. I did not understand the personality he suddenly exhibited. It felt like he was simply moving forward the plot instead of being Four. Plus, he spends all of Allegiant being broken down and we never really see him built back up.3. The PlotThis plot was repetitive. In Insurgent, we have to overthrow the tyranny of Jeanine Mathews. In Allegiant, we have to overthrow the tyranny of Jeanine Mathews 2.0/3.0. It is the same struggle. Of course, on one level that makes sense. Tris is chasing this problem up the chain. She’s discovering that the root of this problem is bigger than Jeanine Mathews and that the outside and its problems never really stayed outside. I did appreciate that aspect. The pacing was an issue. It was slowed considerably by the excessive amount of info dumping and also the dual points of view. It also felt formulaic. It was so paint by numbers and repetitive that it became predictable, in part because Tris is always right and in part because there’s no time for nuance thanks to all the random information being thrown about and all the random things that keep happening. And yet, even with the repetition and the predictability and the deus ex machina moments, this plot was a confused mess and most of it was completely unnecessary to where we went.And good lord the ending of no sense. The holes in this plot were insane. The main conflict seems to be that the Bureau, who has controlled Chicago and Tris’s life, wants the Chicago experiment to keep going. Tris wants those people to know the truth and be free. (Four doesn’t seem to know what the hell he wants). In order to keep things going, the Bureau wants to wipe the memories of Tris’s friends and the families of her friends. Her grand solution? Wipe the memories of the bureau instead. Erase their memories of genetic prejudice....What?We know there are antidotes to basically every serum, from the death serum to the truth serum. We also know there’s an inoculation to the memory/Abnegation serum. So why does it occur to NO ONE that instead of say, inoculating Christina’s family and Uriah’s, that they, say, INNOCULATE EVERYONE?! If they inoculate the people in Chiacago, then David and the Bureau can&apos;t wipe their memories. At the very least, this seemingly obvious solution buys them time to figure out what the hell to do.	Instead, it’s decided Caleb will sacrifice himself by breaking into a vault of memory serum and releasing it into the air before the death serum can claim him (which everyone completely 100% believes will happen and it occurs to no one that Tris of all people will never ever let him do this).Four heads into the city to give the memory serum to only one of his parents because he’ll only have time for one but GASP WHICH WILL HE CHOOSE?! Ok. Let’s think about this. The memory serum is intended to allow the two groups in Chicago to come to an agreement. How on earth does giving Marcus the serum help that goal? Evelyn will still remember that he beat her. Evelyn will still remember that he beat Tobias. Evelyn will still want to prove her strength over him because she rightfully HATES Marcus. So clearly Evelyn is the only logical choice because if she can forget what Marcus did to her, what the factions did to her, she can come to an agreement because she’ll have forgotten all the things that motivated her to fight in the first place. Marcus is just a power hungry dickwad, that&apos;s fundamental to him like knowing how to breathe. Knowing this (and I don’t understand how you could not, especially in the context of Four’s weird relationship with his mother versus the fact that basically he wants his dad to be dead) all the tension is gone from Four making this decision because we all know there is no decision.Of course, knowing this, we also know that Four is never going to give his mother the memory serum. What is completely unbelievable in the end is that Evelyn - the same Evelyn who has proven herself to be a dictator and a tyrant, who abandoned Four, who lied to Four, who tried to push away the only person who has ever supported Four and believed in him in his entire life, the same person who has been motivated by nothing but hate of the factions with seemingly little thought to her son - is magically made reasonable by love of her son. ...what?This makes no sense in the context of what we know about Evelyn based on what we’ve seen her do. She doesn’t even argue with Tobias. It’s just sobbing hugs and forgetting everything she’s done so she can have the PROSPECT of her son one day being in her life. I’m supposed to believe this because we had a scene with her staring at the blue vase she gave him? And, of course, they go out and shake hands with Johanna and Marcus gets his just desserts because everyone knows he is an evil scumbag bent on power and everything magically works out fine despite the fact that people were rioting in the first chapter and the rest of the factionless are just going to forget their anger because they love Tobias...oh wait.Meanwhile, back in the compound...4. The Message?I knew in my gut as soon as I started reading the second instance of Tobias’s point of view that Tris would die. But still, I hoped I was wrong. I wanted to be wrong. And I wanted to be wrong because it doesn’t make any sense with Tris&apos;s growth.Every. Single. Book. Every single book Tris goes off to do some sacrificial act to save the people she cares about. That is basically all she does in Insurgent. And what is her lesson at the end of Insurgent? She wants to live. She doesn’t want to die - she wants to fight and save the world. But we all know as readers, from the moment they mention that stupid vault’s booby trap, that Tris is going to walk into it. We know she is. And...I hated it. First of all, it completely screwed the little character development we’d seen from Caleb. Oh, so Tris points a gun to your head to make you give you the backpack? And you believe her? Stupidest Erudite EVER. Because why would she shoot you, you idiot, if she is about to walk into a death serum pressure cooker TO SAVE YOUR LIFE? It was believable when Tris said she’d shoot David to keep them from getting the password. But she doesn’t want Caleb to die. When he lets her have the backpack - when he lets Tris walk into that chamber? - I have never been so disappointed.I was disappointed in Tris too, because she stole Caleb&apos;s redemption. Maybe he lives and redeems himself in some other way, though considering he was an a
cessory to the slaughter of an entire faction, betrayed his sister, and is generally of weak character, why would anyone believe that he can redeem himself in any other way? So at gunpoint, she steps up to make this sacrifice and we all knew she was going to do it all along and how did Tobias not? I don’t mind character deaths in books. I think, when handled correctly, they are touching scenes that teach the reader something. I think about Dumbledore dying and my chest aches. I think about so many other deaths in books, from Rue in Hunger Games to Bridge to Terebethia, and I know that deaths of characters you love can matter and make a book beautiful and better and teach you things about yourself and the world and love and all of it.But the death has to matter. And Tris’s didn’t. In the (very rushed) end, we find out that people can depend on each other? Can mend each other? We find out that Four is still grieving Tris but is maybe starting to move on, that he doesn’t talk or think about her much because of how much it hurts? Is Peter right? Tobias is young. Someday he’ll move on and he’ll remember Tris, but he’ll keep living. And it’s true; moving on is brave. That’s what life is and what it requires and we have to be grateful for the moments we spend with the people we love and the impact they have. But I needed so much more from Tobias at the end to make his loss of Tris worth that message.I hated, too, the way Tris’s death was handled. Because what was Tris doing? She was running into her mother’s arms and asking if she could be finished. Wanting to be done, implying a choice, even though she JUST told Caleb to tell Tobias that she didn’t want to leave him. If she’d gone down fighting, I’d have bought this more. But she seemed to welcome death - to want it - and that reverts her straight back to the things she supposedly learned she DIDN’T want in InsurgentI don’t understand why Tris’s death did anything to make that message more real. If anything it makes it less so. It’s easy to band together in grief - to find the people who understand and cling to them and form a stronger bond while you do. We saw that already with Christina and Uriah. I think this book wouldn’t have been able to gloss over everything if Tris had lived. Like Uriah’s injury and demise, a lot of this ending was hurriedly tied up with her death. We didn’t have to see what really happened in the aftermath. We didn’t have to deal with the choices for society. Tris’s death was sand for the characters to bury their heads in. This book didn&apos;t have a hopeful ending because nothing really changed. 90% of the characters are dead and everyone forgives everyone almost everything because they care about them? This is the foundation of rebuilding and stability upon which these characters and this world can grow? I’d have given up Tris (and Tris and Four) if it left Four and the the people she cared about with strength and hope and a better world, but I didn’t see that it did.

      This is the greatest review ever. Thank you.
    
  
        
      I just had so many FEELINGS, Stacee! This was how I had to spend my morning.
    
  
        
      I was losing my excitement over it as the release date got closer and once I heard the spoiler, it was gone. I am in no hurry to read this book....
    
  
        
      I wish Caitlin hadn&apos;t listened to me and she&apos;d spoiled me over my objections because I think I&apos;d have handled my disappointment better.
    
  
        
      I figured out the spoiler based on upset tweets and I am... also not in any hurry to finish it. It just sounds so disappointing.
    
  
        
      I just finished Allegiant and I am so disappointed. Thank you for this review it is like you put my feelings into words :)
    
  
        
      Thank-you. Now I don&apos;t have to try to write down all the ways this book disappointed me. You did a wonderful job expressing why this book is so disappointing. I know it&apos;s pretty bad when I did not even care that Uriah died. I was so looking forward to this book, but now I just don&apos;t care. It&apos;s not the ending, the whole book just fell flat.
    
  
        
      I wrote a review feeling angry and upset it made no sense, thanks for making sense of all my feelings of this book
    
  
        
      I&apos;m glad to know I&apos;m not alone with how I felt reading Allegiant. Even two days later I&apos;m still confused. If everyone who comments could please be careful with spoilers - just a cut - because even though I was disappointed I don&apos;t want to be responsible for accidentally spoiling someone else.
    
  
        
      Perfect review is PERFECT.

      This whole review is my GPOY! It&apos;s exactly what I&apos;ve been feeling and saying to people, especially the parts about Tris and Four. I&apos;m still numb, and feel so so let down.
    
  
        
      Thank you for verbalizing every single thought I have been trying to express about this book. Your entire assessment is accurate and I couldn&apos;t help but nod along and verbally &quot;Mhmm&quot; every point as it was made. Kudos!
    
  
        
      Goodreads had insufficient space for all my FEELINGS, so I had to cut them way down haha.
    
  
        
      Wow!! Totally spot on review. Very disappointed in this book,and I&apos;m only halfway through.

      Lady, I do not know you, but thank you for writing this review. I just read and nodded.
    
  
        
      Wow, THIS IS SUCH A FANTASTIC REVIEW! I kept nodding my head vigorously and saying things like &quot;OMG YES&quot; the whole time I was reading it XD Some thoughts:1. The world building has always been one of the weakest links in this series. For the most part, I have tried to ignore it while I was reading the previous two books but I really expected/needed this last book to at least try to explain the ridiculous pillars upon which this world is built. You are right about the massive info dump in this book. I feel like literally 1/2 of this book was just Tris &amp; Co learning stuff--but not in the fun way that characters usually learn about things. Nearly all the major plot points and details about this world are learned via exposition from characters like David, Nita, or Matthew. This pattern is fairly recognizable from the previous two books as well. Why is it that Tris never learns anything in any other way? Why doesn&apos;t she ever overhear secret conversations, go investigating and stumble upon confidential files, or just try to figure it out herself using that Erudite brain of hers? Exposition is still a great way to reveal things to the reader and protagonist, but in this series it&apos;s always been overdone. As a result, you sit through most of Allegiant listening to people go on and on and on...Arguably, this book suffered from it the worst because it is the last book and it needed to answer those questions we all had. Which brings me to the next point you mentioned: &quot;a lot of what Tris has to figure out is science and history, and there&apos;s not the sufficient background needed to help with suspension of disbelief&quot;I agree so hard with this! Even what they did try to explain to our protagonist just didn&apos;t make any sense. Somewhere, a bio major is reading this book and crying. 2. The &quot;character development&quot; was laughable. I wouldn&apos;t even call it &quot;development&quot; because it&apos;s all either so contrived or ridiculously overdone. Even Uriah’s injury and death felt like a plot point for Four that was ultimately completely glossed over.Agreed. I feel like the only reason this was even in the book was to give Four something to needlessly angst over. Like &quot;omg I made a promise to Zeke and now I&apos;ve broken it! I&apos;m a bad person and I suck!!!!11!!!&quot; Why was this a necessary journey for Four to go on? Arguably, Roth was trying to give Four some internal conflict and give Tris a reason to be mad at him. But in the end, his narrative always read as being whiny, annoying, and terribly uncharacteristic. For example, Four finds out that he’s not really divergent (um, ok?), and then he completely breaks down and immediately loses all the growth he’d accomplished in the first two books and does something stupid.Why was the fact that he wasn&apos;t &quot;actually Divergent&quot; have such an emotional impact on him? I mean, it&apos;s not like he lost the gene he has to be aware in simulations. Even Tris makes a valid point to him that he&apos;s the same person he was yesterday. And considering that Four would derive is his sense of self from his divergence, his fears, his experiences growing up, his relationship with his parents and his friends, it seems stupid to me for him to break down over the fact that he&apos;s not technically Divergent. Like was that really so important him? Was his Divergence really the defining aspect of his character? Because gee, I don&apos;t know, I always thought Four&apos;s four fears were the thing most people remember about him. I feel like this was another contrived characterization moment just to give him some motivation to help with Nita and her terrorist plot.
    
  
        
      I think you wrote my review, only better. The David thing didn&apos;t make sense, but like you said - since Tris is always right he must be the bad guy even though we&apos;re presented with evidence by a terrorist with an agenda. sigh. I&apos;m accepting of it but disappointed and just sold my copy for half of what I paid for it. I&apos;ve not been able to stop thinking about it since I finished it. Tris was the strongest female protagonist I have ever read about and I just wonder... wtf happened?! I had an idea of the ending as soon as the plan happened. but ffs.
    
  
        
      Andi wrote: Was his Divergence really the defining aspect of his character?

I just don&apos;t understand what was happening with him, which is strange because we had his POV in Allegiant and we didn&apos;t in the first two and I understood him perfectly. It was just a strange series of issues for him and we never really saw anything resolve.And I obviously agree about the world building. I didn&apos;t mind the lack of it in the first two, mostly because why would Tris wonder about why things were the way they were until Marcus tells her about the secret. Veronica Roth said in an interview that she always knew how the third book would end but how it got there changed, and I can completely see that in the way this book played out. And it&apos;s unfortunate because this really does feel like a completely separate book as far as plot and universe.That&apos;s what made the ending lack impact for me. I mean (view spoiler)[David is not punished and lives and...what? And if Tris is labeled a terrorist/rebel why are the rest of them allowed to just walk away? (hide spoiler)] I&apos;m still confused even now about all of that.Basically I&apos;m still just kind of confused in general.
    
  
        
      thank you for writing this! i&apos;m not even finish with the book, but i&apos;m an end reader and when i found out, i was outraged. 18 hours later i am still angry. i am now forcing myself to finish the book although i have lost the will to do so. this really ruins the whole divergent series for me and i am beyond disappointed.
    
  
        
      Amazing review you&apos;re dead on. You turned my jumbled thoughts into organized writing. Can I just be the first to nominate you to rewrite allegiant?
    
  
        
      Your review was everything I wanted mine to be - my thoughts exactly, just put together much much better. thank you!
    
  
        
      Great review. I feel exactly the same way about EVERY single point you hit. It&apos;s like you stepped into me head and stole all my thoughts. I think you actually did :) Thank you! Unlike the book, this review is satisfying.
    
  
        
      Great review. I agree with a lot of what you said. I had issues with the book way before the big ending. You just put it into words, so thank you.
    
  
        
      Really really good review. Agree with you almost completely; I hate it when a point of view is added deep into the series.
    
  
        
      YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!Amazing review! I agree with everything you had to say! Your review was 10 times more interesting than the book! Thank you! xo
    
  
        
      something that REALLY pissed me off was how, at the end of the little epilogue Roth have us, Tobias is talking to Christina and her reason for everything that happened is &quot;lol life sucks but I&apos;m waiting for when it doesn&apos;t.&quot; Are. You. Kidding me??? That&apos;s the thing we&apos;ve been waiting for? THAT&apos;S the lesson that Roth communicates to us? Forget the big picture, you&apos;re just going to say, basically &quot;shit happens, goodbye&quot; and that&apos;s it? Tobias just nods and goes &quot;oh yeah, people mend each other tragedy is part of life blah blah blah&quot; but guess what? WE ALREADY KNEW THAT! What. The. Fuck.
    
  
        
      100000000% agree.
    
  
        
      Thank you. You just saved me money. I just had a feeling this last book would disappoint. I decided to wait for awhile so I could read some reviews. Now I&apos;m terribly sad that we waited so long for an ending like this. But it sounds like the whole book was just terrible, the ending being the final nail. I will just keep my imaginary ending in my head, and advise everyone I told about this book to read some reviews. Or to borrow a copy. Or to just forget about it and pick up a new series like The Hollows.
    
  
        
      You verbalized SO WELL how I felt after reading this. You broke it DOWN! Great, great, great review. I was such a tangled, confused mess of disappointment after reading the last sentence, and books rarely ever disappointment me. They&apos;re either in a &quot;hated it&quot;, &quot;loved it&quot; or &quot;just meh&quot; category. But this one hurt my soul.

The conclusion to this series. I was left so disappointed and heart broken that I put so much of my time in waiting and in reading. And it&apos;s not even because of the ending, Tris&apos;s death. It&apos;s b/c the whole book was just awful. :(
    
  
        
      Best review of this book I&apos;ve read. The first thing I did when I finished the book was come on goodreads so I could virtually commiserate with my fellow book lovers! I knew I could not be the only one who felt like this whole book was one giant let down. And lol @ the &quot;there was a lot of making out.&quot; I feel like if she was going to end things how she did, we should have had a few more deets in the makeout sessions ;-)
    
  
        
      This is definitely one of the best book reviews I&apos;ve ever read. Certainly the best for Allegiant. I agree with everything you said and you</obo:OWLDataProperty_00000000000000000051>

           1.5 StarsBooks are a magical thing. They get you invested in people, worlds, scenarios that aren’t even real or plausible and they make you care about them. If done correctly, I should say. Allegiant was certainly the final book of a hype-copter of a series that left millions of readers invested. Like a few other books this past year, it has left a feeling of doubt, anger, and a lot of crying.But for me, I was left with a sort of empty feeling. Some of the emptiness was filled by frustration, and for the most part, I don’t understand it. So if I leave my thoughts, I think I can at least pass on why this book has 1.5 stars and not a glistening five.We start off with the idea that there is a whole world beyond Chicago’s fence. I mean that&apos;s fairly easy to catch. But I’m concerned as to how anyone could manage to understand the rest of this series, especially when it decides to double onto itself to make THE most convoluted plot I’ve ever had the misfortune to decipher in YA. Now lemme explain: if this convoluted plot actually made sense and didn’t leave me wanting to go back to the equally stupid but at least interesting concept of the factions, then I wouldn’t be as frustrated as I am. Not nearly. I’ll be stumbling into some spoilers so it’s only fair that I slam the spoiler button.Here Comes the Boom Breakdown(view spoiler)[WRITING/PLOTWHY THE EVERLOVING FUCK DID THIS TAKE SO LONG.Divergent, as you might of guessed, made me interested in the series because the pacing, while crippling and slow, left a snap to it that kept me incredibly invested in whatever the hell was going on. The Factions were originally a stupid idea to me because it easily set up an opening for war. No one looks at that system and says, “Wow what a good idea!” It screams disorganization and inequality. There’s clearly a war to be had.Now Insurgent gave us a smidge of what was to be expected, and while nothing continued to happen, we get dumped on with the idea that this entire society was only a FEW GENERATIONS OLD. If I remember correctly, it wasn’t even that many generations, like three. That could be any stretch of time that could amount to a century. Do you know HOW MUCH CHANGE can come through a century? You go 100 years ago and you have the start of WWI where helicopters didn’t exist and the Titanic sunk two years before that. Now we have shit called computers that have as much potential as the baby TV/computer/telephone things we shove in our pockets.There’s no way a system of Factions would last a century without something like the Hunger Games where a war might’ve happened and possibly failed.Now I’m assuming this was seen as ridiculous, because Allegiant takes this society and makes it an experiment. An experiment to bring forth the Divergent, which is actually defined at last! It’s not just serum-avoiding magic, but genetic purity! Because…because purity is made by fucking around with Mendel Punnett squares! There is ALWAYS a way to fix personality without fucking with everything else! Just look at fruit flies! Now they’re all able to avoid our serums! Thanks, you adorable squares!NO.LEARN A BIT OF BIO BEFORE YOU THINK THAT THIS MAKES ANY SORT OF SENSE.The Factions were formed as a means of living and value, why the fuck does genetic material and serums even matter to VALUES and LIVING SITUATIONS. Because those who switch their faction are clearly more genetically pure than those “damaged”? You know, NORMAL people!Anyhow, the writing for this is a lot of telling. You get that thing I mentioned in the last book’s review where the characters are telling me how they act so I can trust them. “I loved Caleb, but I didn’t want to forgive him because I’m not a forgiving type.” I WANT TO KNOW YOUR TRAITS THROUGH SHOW. The fact that I still got this was a way of saying, “dunno if you know that my character fucking loves the color chartreuse, but I HAVE TO TELL YOU. SO HERE.”It grates on me so hard and it’s even worse because I got DOUBLE the telling thanks to the dual POV of Tris and Tobias. You’d think that because you have two different people talking, you’d get some difference between the characters…AHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAA are you fucking serious, since when have you had that in YA. NEVER YOU FUCKERS. YOU CAN NEVER HAVE DIFFERENT CHARACTERS EVER AGAIN.Is it really hard to change the voice of characters? That should be the easiest thing in the world, but apparently it’s just so hard. :(But yeah, the whole government was all about making city societies to forge these genetically pure people that do nothing but avoid the serums that they themselves produce because whatever. There actually is no point to the serums except maybe give the heads in the cities some control. THERE IS NO POINT TO THE SERUMS EXCEPT TO BE THERE.Another thing: I also wouldn’t mind the whole government creation of genetically pure breeding camps if it didn’t completely nullify the idea of the fucking Factions. The Factions purposefully threw people apart and the ONLY time they intermingled was during Choosing Ceremonies and switching over. Like, why establish separation to that extreme and expect pure little genetic babies out of it?It’s not thought through in the slightest. And it doesn’t help that Tris and Tobias are told this and barely react to it. They react with a cheesy camera zoom-in, gasp, and then it’s gone and they just accept it because it’s outside the fence. URRGHH NO. I think the worst thing to happen was the characters, so I’m gonna go over that way.CHARACTERSTris, first and foremost, is a LOT better than she was in Insurgent. Because I finally figured out what the hell she was doing with her life and her own decisions. She showed her change into the bravery that she originally wanted to have way back in Divergent. But what I didn’t like was that she had to die.The main reason this irks me is because Tris, above anything else, had shown nothing in her arc to suggest that she had to go and kill herself when clearly Caleb had to redeem himself. His reaction to the situation was great I think. Be scared to commi suicide, realize that’s how everyone will be saved, then accepts his death. HE ACCEPTS IT. THEN TRIS TAKES IT AWAY BECAUSE…???Now here’s how I would kind of understand Tris’ actions a little more. If she were actually still very caring towards her brother DESPITE his asshole nature and she fought with him to handle the bomb into the Weapons Lab, that’d be something. I’d understand that she is so desperate to save her [last] family member, that she does what she considers the right thing and takes the explosives from him. It’d be reckless, but I see it as brave because she channels the sacrifice like her mother channeled the sacrifice. Because she didn’t care about Caleb at all (while also totally understandable), I’m left with this conclusion of “Uhhh??” for why Tris took Caleb’s position when he clearly chose to redeem himself.TOBY, however, got infinitely worse in this book. He melted into a pansy. And he was the one to use similes as often as he could as he told other people about his character traits. He started to become Cassandra Clare prose basically and that is NOT what I needed in Allegiant.Positives for these two consist of their relationship. It is awesome and magical in the sense that they have the struggles of telling the truth and lying to protect each other and they SIT DOWN and DISCUSS these problems. A fucking plus because seriously everything is like, “No I must protect you now sit your ass down and lemme do it blah blah blah”. Tris actually sits and ponders if she really wants to deal with Toby if he keeps acting the way he does, and Toby, while a bit sad about that decision making, understands and doesn’t infringe upon it. You win this round, you two.What definitely pisses me off to no end (and this was Insurgent as well) was the fact that the side/minor characters are fucking nothing. THEY ARE NOTHING. They have no arcs or situations, and the three people who came close to having such a thing were Christina, Uriah, and Peter.BUT WHAT HAPPENS? Peter is so ingrained with being a nosy asswipe and a half (but get this, he’s really good on the inside. He doesn’t want to remember what an asshat he was). I would be okay with this if this was fucking present in the series at all. He hurt and assaulted people in the first book, somewhat gets betterby helping Tris because it benefited him, then WHOOSH he doesn’t want to deal with the effects of any of that? It comes out of the sky 80% of the way through the book and blows up what his entire character was about. I’m pissed about this because I enjoyed asshole Peter and the idea that he was beginning a change for the better. Erasing your memories is not a good change.URIAH was good, up until he just, you know, got blown up. If it felt necessary, again, I would be okay with this. I feel like deaths for characters should have some sort of reasoning attached. I feel cheated when characters just DIE. The upside to this fiasco was that he (unless OTHER dystopias that rhyme with Funger Lames) had closure. Nicely done closure that I can appreciate.This also goes along with Christina. She had great building in Insurgent or at least at the start of it. She gets more detail with her family, but it’s not like it really goes anyway. We learn about her but that’s…kind of it. She gets her screen tie and then she’s done. I’m not seeing the love for the characters and that breaks my heart a little. STRUCTUREThis was a lot like Divergent where there’s a ton of decent writing but not much plot movement. This started with a decent jump to outside the fence and before we were a quarter way through the book, we knew what everything really was. That was nice! But then it just did a plateau and nothing happened until a little over halfway through the book. There should be moments that keep you interested that aren’t all romantic subplot related. This is like, Writing 101. Come on now children.However, I really enjoyed the wrap up of Tris’s death despite it being the route that shouldn’t have been. The closure for Tris was, in my opinion, the best part of the book (and interestingly enough, not because it was finally over and done with). Uriah had a great close, Christina was a little better and there was actual friend bonding with her and Toby which like…never happened until just then in that moment.Eh, minor characters aren’t allowed such interactions it seems.  (hide spoiler)]OVERALLThe half star is devoted to the few moments in Allegiant that caught my attention and made me feel better about the characters/plot/stuff. The rest was just something I want to forget. It’s way too convoluted and unknowing of what the fuck it wants to be. The fact that I want to go back to the Factions as they were is a message in and of itself.I feel like this book scarred me that way, but hey, guess what it did do. It made me get way into my own works to go and prove to myself that I can achieve more than what this did. THE SCARRING WILL PUSH ME THROUGH.TIME WILL HEAL ALL WOUNDS.---------------------------------EDIT THE SECOND:Well bust my buttons, look at that cover.Holy fuck.Edit:Allegiant?But it...breaks the pattern outside of sounding similar! D:LOOK AT MY MASTERPIECE.I should snag a job as a cover artist.Needs more Comic Sans...*shot*
         
      Yes, put the title in huge glaring Comic Sans and put the author&apos;s name and mini-review in PAPYRUS! :D
    
  
        
      The characters would be singing, &quot;We found Dove in a soapless place!&quot;

      It didn&apos;t exactly break the pattern... it is still pronounced with the same &quot;-gent&quot; sound that the others are pronounced with, just spelled differently because the English language is silly! uh-lee-jent, not uh-lee-jee-unt
    
  
        
      but it&apos;s not just the -gent, it&apos;s the missing uhr-jent like Insurgent and Divergent that makes it seem really out of placeit&apos;s not a huge deal, but once you establish a particular pattern it&apos;s normal for people to expect it to continue I guess

      WTF happened to this series. I only read the fist book and it was alright. But WHAT with the factions and the serums and especially the fact that this world or w/e is only a few generations old.Could have sworn the book took place in the future of earth.
    
  
        
      the only difference between Tobias and Tris&apos; voice was that Toby seems to think himself a burgeoning poet with an overuse of similes, metaphors and inner angsting.
    
  
        
      &quot;If you didn’t catch that in the first book, I’m concerned as to how you managed to understand the rest of this series…&quot;I love reading how different people are affected by books that I have read, it doesn&apos;t matter if they loved it or hated it but when they word their opinions like you did above… well I kinda lose interest in what else you want to say cos things start sounding too conceited and condescending.Just saying… hope you understand where I&apos;m coming from

      Your review put to words all of the feelings I felt about this book. I felt so angry I couldn&apos;t even form a proper sentence. So, thanks. Haha.
    
  
        
      hahahahaha, I laughed so hard. Bravo, I clap and I bow.
    
  
        
      LOVE the COVER 
    
  
        
      I also LOVE your first 2 sentences in your review :) Tempted to Plagiarise lol ; )&quot; It&apos;s so well put and shows how vulnerable we, the readers become, but it is Never talked about!!!
    
  
        
      I wanted to punch something after this book. I agree that the cracks started in Insurgent. Did not like this book. It felt rushed and jumbled.
    
  
        
      Veronica Roth, you wound me. I&apos;m devastated.
    
  
        
      since I first heard of divergent I have been saying ditergent. I&apos;m glad I&apos;m not alone. love the cover.
    
  
        
      One choice can cleanse you. Forget being a cover artist, you should be an advertiser! (No offense).
    
  
        
      What pissed me off the most is that the passcode was so freaking obvious. When David was freaking out and saying Her..... come on. He was in Love with Tris&apos;s mom. Anyone else realize her mom&apos;s name was probably the fucking code?
    
  
        
      I loved your review, I agree on everything, I could not have expressed it better myself. For me the big let down of this book is that Roth had a great story in her hand and a lot of power (especially because it was a book targeted for YA). But with big power comes big responsibilities and I feel that in that sense the third book delivered all the wrong messages somehow. The only slightly positive message that I managed to get (and I am 42, not 15) is that no matter what bad things life throws at you, there are also some good ones and you hang on for those. Other than that I felt hopeless and very sad at the end of the book. I am not against the main good character dying per se, but if you kill her you have to do it well and for very good reasons and I felt both elements were missing in Roth&apos;s ending.
    
  
        
      &quot;You’d think that because you have two different people talking, you’d get some difference between the characters…AHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAA are you fucking serious, since when have you had that in YA.&quot;ummm.... since Melvin Burgess&apos; Smack ? (otherwise known as Junk ) ~~ first published way back in the 90s. It&apos;s YA and uses many different POVs, which all sound very different;-) YA is not all bad.

           If in your story the word &apos;genetics&apos; could have just as easily been replaced with the word &apos;magic&apos; or &apos;voodoo&apos; or &apos;pepperoni&apos;, your premise may seriously need some rethinking.¹¹ Why do I care? Well, education took me on the path from biology to medicine, and so I don&apos;t take f*cking with genetics lightly. Well, now against all odds (and against my self-preservation sense) I finished this series. And it was not very good. Really, it wasn&apos;t. It could have been somewhat salvageable - if only the author was able to recapture the unabashed mindless fun entertainment that &apos;Divergent&apos; was able to pull off. But, alas, it lost the fun aspect completely, and what was left when entertainment was removed turned out to be insufficient to fill the resulting void.
  Instead, this book just serves to cement how this series was poorly thought through from the beginning, unsure of its own premise, uncertain of its message, unsure of where it was supposed to be headed, disjointed in its ideas and concepts, and never becoming a coherent whole.
Just to clarify - my disappointment has nothing to do with the widely publicized &quot;controversial&quot; ending - or at least not with the part of the ending (a certain character&apos;s fate (view spoiler)[Tris dies - and that part was not that unexpected given her semi-suicidal inclinations and sudden introduction of Tobias&apos; perspective in the story (hide spoiler)]) that has quite a few people freak out. No, my biggest disappointment is with the fickle way this series reached its resolution.You see, far from trying to resolve any of the old conflicts built up in the previous two books, this story decides to just abruptly swing to another issue - &apos;genetically pure&apos; vs. &apos;genetically damaged&apos;, carelessly dismissing the dystopian Chicago world as though it had never happened in favor of the new development. As much as I was making fun of the ridiculous premise of this faction-based encapsulated society, I really did not appreciate sudden treatment of it as little but an unfortunate afterthought, a setting that doesn&apos;t matter much, a place that we abruptly leave and only visiting again as a &quot;by the way&quot;, thus making all the buildup of the (admittedly, ridiculous) conflicts of the previous two books absolutely pointless.Instead of resolving the issues and conflicts with the established characters and developing these characters further so that they in the end would not look like cardboard cutouts, we are introduced to the slew of new characters which basically are just mashups of the old characters and are there for reasons unclear - but I&apos;d at least like to assume are different than Roth simply getting distracted by the new shiny idea.And the end of the huge conflict is done with a Whimper of all Whimpers - the slaughter facing the city is stopped by little else than basically a family reunion. Because Love heals, my friends. Because as long as the character&apos;s parents face their conflicts, the entire world becomes a better place to live. And no, this is NOT done from the perspective a a five-year-old. And suddenly the world becomes a better place, just because two adults have finally had a conversation. Because everyone else will just blindly follow the two semi-questionable leaders.We also get a few heavy moralistic lessons and insights into the natures of what&apos;s good and what&apos;s evil. 
  What we learn is that Good is what Tris believes in and agrees with.
 Anything that she is not personally invested in is therefore Evil. For instance, it&apos;s only EVIL to erase memories of those she cares about. Even if the justification for both acts is identical - to prevent violence and deaths. By this book, Tris is not only the 80-pound badass of all badasses out there; she is infallible, flawless, selfless, unerringly perceptible, basically a new Messiah or, if you are as dorky as I am, basically an incarnation of Neo from the Matrix minus the ridiculous but cool black leather duster. And I found it to be eye-rollingly annoying.This book is mostly told in alternating chapters by Tris and Tobias. It does help to read the title of each chapter to remember who the narrator is supposed to be because otherwise their voices are completely indistinguishable. Quite a few times I got halfway through a chapter before remembering that the narrator had changed. That does not a skillful narration make, my friends.Overall, this series started ridiculous but fun, quickly deteriorated and finished on the note sour enough to give me a semi-permanent scowl. Nothing too memorable, honestly, except for very poor use of genetics. 1.5 stars, rounding up to 2.And for the inevitable few fans of this book and this series who will disagree with my opinion by insinuating that I&apos;m not that bright and actually quite crazy, I have the retort by Dr. Sheldon Cooper, PhD:.................------------And if you care:My review of &apos;Divergent&apos;.My review of &apos;Insurgent&apos;.
         
        
      All of this. Great review, Nataliya. :)
    
  
        
      Excellent review! I doubt I&apos;ll be reading this book (thanks to your review and many others), even though I read both &quot;Divergent&quot; and &quot;Insurgent&quot; - unless, of course, my completist attitude catches up with me!
    
  
        
      I strongly agree, Nataliya. The jumping from one unresolved conflict to another is so wrong. It adds to confusion and an unwell-defined plot and story.
    
  
        
      I saw one review of this book that just said &quot;I hate you&quot; to the author over and over in a block. So your review is more measured but also negative. Here&apos;s my question: does the frustrating ending make you not recommend the first book? Should I just pass?
    
  
        
      You said it better than I ever could, Nataliya. Excellent review, shitty book.

It was certainly entertaining while not being that well-written. However, it had a spirit of reckless fun that was quite appealing. It appeared to be a book excellently suited for a mindless action-filled flick - no wonder they are making a movie out of it. You won&apos;t miss on much if you just pass on the first book and the entire series, but if you are looking for a few hours of mindless fun the first ne may be well-suited for that.

      Olga, you have to click on &quot;see review&quot; for the images to show up :)Great job as always Nataliya! I will read it, just to complete the set, but I am pretty much over it. Have you read Demetria Luna&apos;s In The After? To me that was a better start to a post-A YA series than pretty much any I&apos;ve read.

      I rated the book higher, but I agree with everything you&apos;ve said here.
    
  
        
      I applaud you for finishing the book. I couldn&apos;t. I liked Divergent more than I thought and Insurgent was okay. I thought the series could be salvaged, but this book confused me on so many levels. What a shame. Great review.
    
  
        
      All this makes me glad I stopped at Divergent.
    
  
        
      If you do read In The After, I&apos;d be interested in what you think. I was very impressed by it, obviously I can&apos;t judge it as a series until the other books come out, but the first one was certainly better than Divergent, Chemical Garden, Delirium or Matched, equal to The Hunger Games, maybe better if only because there was no romance, which I appreciated. The swoony teen romantic aspect of so many of these dystopian YA novels often seems to bog them down or trivialize them for me, so it was refreshing to have one where she has a brief mild attraction to someone, but it&apos;s not a major plot point.
    
  
        
      curious! I have it on hold. I really enjoyed Divergent, and Insurgent a bit less so. The author thanked Jesus in her acknowledgments in the first book, which always sets alarm bells clanging about her education, particularly in the sciences. Could it be related?? Also the weirdly stark good v. evil you reference.
    
  
        
      So when are you going to write this pepperoni-oriented YA series?
    
  
        
      I appreciate your dedication to finish the series Nataliya. I balked after reading the initial spoilery-reviews. While that ending is brave in theory, Roth is not someone I&apos;d trust to pull that kind of thing off.Great review :)
    
  
        
      Brilliant, one of the best reviews I&apos;ve read.
    
  
        
      Thank you, I LOVED the first book, was sorely disappointed by the second, and now you&apos;ve saved me from blowing hard earned cash on the third :) That&apos;s your good deed done for the day!
    
  
        
      I know exactly what happens at the end of this book and it makes me grateful that I didn&apos;t read the second one, even though I really enjoyed the first book.

Here&apos;s my question: does the frustrating ending ...&quot;The ending isn&apos;t &quot;frustrating.&quot; Take it from someone who has been waiting two years for this series to finish, the ending was well thought out entirely. I went back and reread the whole series after knowing the ending, and the way the author (Veronica Roth) tied the whole series together was perfect. The story was never about what everyone assumed it was about. It&apos;s about Tris finding the balance between selflessness and bravery, and realizing the actual meaning of self-sacrifice. In Insurgent, and even Divergent, Tris throws her life away in desperate attempts to be &quot;self-sacrificing.&quot; But in Allegiant, she finally learns what it means. And her journey comes to a beautiful end. I&apos;m sorry to say that some people take a more negative approach on the series- that it&apos;s just about the action, or just about the love story. It has a deeper message. So if my word means anything to you, maybe you&apos;ll give Allegiant a chance. I can&apos;t see reading the first two and then just giving up, anyway. :)
    
  
        
      I have a feeling you didn&apos;t look very much past the &quot;lack of action.&quot; To me, the book held a deeper purpose than to just be filled with butt-kicking and gun-shooting.
    
  
        
      I love your review. I&apos;m so sorry I even read the book.

I think I made it clear that I disliked the lack of consistency and the lack of focus in this series, and would have preferred if conflicts were actually resolved instead of being abandoned. I disliked the treatment of the heroine as a flawless sacrificial lamb. But I never complained about action or lack thereof in this book. That would be the least of what I disliked about it.
    
  
        
      Elizabeth. I think it is narrow-minded to assume that just because Roth thanks Jesus in her acknowledgements that she is poorly educated in science. Why is it that people have to assume that God and science are mutually exclusive?
    
  
        
      Well you make it quite clear in the review that you are only capable of pointing out negative things in this book, which is pretty pathetic. First of all, this book is focused for a younger audience, maybe a reason you found it horrible. You also obviously enjoyed reading the books to some extent if you CONTINUED to finish the series after you wrote a horrible review for the first one. It also seems that you&apos;re just looking for excuses to use all your Sheldon Cooper images. For every negative, and accurate, virtue you could point out in this series, I&apos;m sure there are easily two positive virtues. So, when you are a 25-year-old who is making millions of dollars off her first ever book series, please come find me. I&apos;d LOVE to write a review about your book and point out all the inaccurate flaws within it. Please stop being so harsh. This book has taught millions of teens and young adults lessons that can not be learned too easily, myself included. I value the words in these books because they have taught me so much. And I&apos;m sorry to say that my favoritism for these books is making me a little bit bitter, but I don&apos;t understand how you could find the Divergent series so horrible when I love it so much. I read all three reviews, I just can&apos;t relate.

First of all, this book is focused for a younger audienc...&quot;I can think of many, many, many teens (even those among my followers on Goodreads) who did not like this book at all, for presentation or thematic (or both). Ageist commentary does no favors for anyone. You can be of any age to be critical of a book, or of any background beyond being a writer. You can be of any age as a writer and still have valid criticisms against your work for the way its presented among other factors.Opinion is opinion. People have one, and do not have to participate in group think or share the same experience or interpretation. As well, people can be critical of something they&apos;ve read, and pick up books for a variety of reasons other than liking/disliking. It doesn&apos;t exist in a vacuum or singular dimension.I thought Nataliya explicated her thoughts wonderfully here, and it&apos;s not just for the fact that she shares parts of my interpretation of the work, but for what her thoughts lend in and of themselves. You&apos;re more than welcome to think differently and like this work, but you are not allowed to condescend or belittle her thoughts here.

I read all three reviews, I just can&apos;t relate.&quot;I don&apos;t need you to relate to me. I don&apos;t need you to understand me. I don&apos;t expect any of these things. What I do expect is that you understand that since we are different people with different personalities, ages and backgrounds we would have very different reactions to this book. We don&apos;t have to agree, and both of us have the right to our own opinions. Apparently you think mine are pathetic. I find yours condescending. Here, we&apos;re even now.&quot;First of all, this book is focused for a younger audience, maybe a reason you found it horrible.&quot;I refuse to accept the excuse that you can give a book a free pass just because it&apos;s aimed at younger people. Bad book is bad regardless of the intended audience. As a matter of fact, I think it&apos;s even more important to have good books for younger people than for adults because literature can influence the mind that is still forming, and I would hope the influence would be a good one.And there are plenty of writers who can produce books for younger audience that are of remarkable quality. Some examples: Frances Hardinge, Terry Pratchett, China Mieville, J.K. Rowling, Neil Gaiman, E. Lockhart, Ray Bradbury (in a way), just to name a few. Laini Taylor and Melina Marchetta can also probably be mentioned in this category. &quot;You also obviously enjoyed reading the books to some extent if you CONTINUED to finish the series after you wrote a horrible review for the first one.&quot;I gave three stars to the first book; I thought it was quite entertaining. That&apos;s far from the definition of &apos;horrible&apos; that I use. Yes, I thought it was ridiculous, but it was still fun. The first book made me eventually curious about the second book; after the second book I continued to read just for the completion sake.&quot;It also seems that you&apos;re just looking for excuses to use all your Sheldon Cooper images.&quot;No. The review was written first; the fun search for images followed later. And I never need an excuse to use Sheldon Cooper images.&quot;So, when you are a 25-year-old who is making millions of dollars off her first ever book series, please come find me. I&apos;d LOVE to write a review about your book and point out all the inaccurate flaws within it.&quot;Ah, I&apos;m so tired of this line - &quot;Let&apos;s see if you can write a better book!&quot; I think I will just stick with my regular job, if that&apos;s okay with everyone. I will leave writing books to others, including Veronica Roth. But you are welcome to criticize my hospital charts - they are full of awkward grammar and terrible punctuation, and there is no plot to speak of.&quot;I value the words in these books because they have taught me so much.&quot; I&apos;m glad your experience with these books was so positive. Mine wasn&apos;t. They did not teach me a thing, but in all honesty I did not expect them to. I treated these books as nothing else but entertainment, and after the first book they stopped being fun. And now I have to get back to work.
    
  
        
      I applaud you for finishing the series. The first book was already more than enough for me. And you have no idea how much I appreciate you still voicing your honest opinions despite all the crap that people (and the site) throw at you! :)
    
  
        
      This is the review I wanted to write! I agree with all of your points and if I could do spoilers, I would have some additional criticisms. I loved Divergent! Read it in one night and raved about it to all my friends. Insurgent was...okay. Not nearly as engaging. But this book? Meh. Bad writing, worse plot devices and a big disappointment.
    
  
        
      I love your review! No one came back from death and it makes so much sense that I finish reading it.
    
  
        
      The series lost me when Tris&apos; parents were murdered and a couple of paragraphs later she was like,&apos;well, at least Four is hot.&apos;
    
  
        
      thank you for this! I&apos;ve been staring at the book in the store, wondering if I dared to buy it . . . now, I know that if I do give it a chance, it would be best to get it from my library.
    
  
        
      Pamela wrote: &quot;The series lost me when Tris&apos; parents were murdered and a couple of paragraphs later she was like,&apos;well, at least Four is hot.&apos;&quot;LOL! For me it was when one of those Dauntless so BRAVELY jumped out of the train and died. They expected me to find that sad..?
    
  
        
      Someone spoiled this ending for me, and I&apos;ll admit it irked me quite a bit, especially after Insurgent failed to provide the same level of entertainment that Divergent did. It just doesn&apos;t make sense within the complete body of work. But I understand that for every person, like myself, who thought it was a bad move, you&apos;ll find others who loved it. So, while I can&apos;t say anything about the genetics/science of the book - the bio major within me would convulse anyhow - I always found the basic concept of divergence incredibly flawed. Veronica Roth never learned how to science, apparently.In any case, you review pretty much highlights all the reasons I will never pick this book up, least of all the ending. Thanks for writing it!
    
  
        
      Yes, she lost me at genetics. That was my first clue. By the time I reached the horrid ending, I didn&apos;t even care. To completely invest me through two books to make me completely indifferent by the third takes massive talentlessness. Hats off.
    
  
        
      I also love how the mom who&apos;s hardly been in Tobias&apos; life tells Tris she will always be around and claims that Tris who HAS been there for him won&apos;t. Tris and readers laugh this off, but then it turns out to be true. Come on, seriously? And for a book that claims everything is complicated sure simplified the mother-son reunion. So her &quot;picking&quot; you as an 18 year old erases her leaving you at the mercy of an abusive father as a five year old? Sure. She goes from being a complete power hungry jerk to loving mother with no warning. Just oh so many things wrong with this story that happened long before the crummy end.
    
  
        
      Love love LOVE this review, Nataliya. I didn&apos;t bother picking up the series finale when it came out, as I thought more about it, the series as a whole was pretty mediocre, and I&apos;d rather spend my money on good things. Your review has definitely reaffirmed my choice to boycott it :)
    
  
        
      Lol, I haven&apos;t read this yet, so only skimmed your review. I have to read the ending... against my better judgement... I do. There are only a few series that I actually gave up on (most of them I should have) and I&apos;m afraid this won&apos;t be one of them. I think I might have a slight case of OCD. ;)
    
  
        
      This review explains how i feel better than I can ever write it. I wish I stopped at Divergent. This book just ruins the entire series for me, not because of Tris&apos; death. In fact, if Tris&apos; death (the entire book actually) was better written, it would have made a blip in this emotional flat line the book has given me.
    
  
        
      This is such a perfect review. You said everything I attempted to say but couldn&apos;t organize into proper thoughts because I was so busy ranting.
    
  
        
      I have to admit I loved the first two! But I completely agree on this one. I thought I was the only person who lost track of who was speaking couldn&apos;t for the life of me tell the difference it was terrible! I also agree with the two conflicts it&apos;s a lot of nothing going on. I can also handle people dying but really the ability to do all the other things but you can&apos;t fix a gun shot wound... Really?! Ok I think I&apos;ve ranted enough on someone else&apos;s page!
    
  
        
      Great review. I had the same thoughts. I was so extremely disappointed with the non-revelations. Divergent? Sorry, it&apos;s really nothing, man.
    
  
        
      This sort of book is what can happen when a book is hyped before the series is finished. Even worse, this book is the sort of thing that can happen when the movie rights are sold before the series is finished.If the movie is successful (which I am uncertain about--the trailer seemed to make very little sense, and I&apos;ve read the darned book), they&apos;re going to have a heck of time trying to make sense of Roth&apos;s world.

  After Reading:
I just don&apos;t know how I feel right now!
  Before Reading:
Edit#3: Here&apos;s another awesome cover by a fan &lt;3 brilliant work !!!Edit#2:Ok this is so freaky 600 likes guys awesome!!! :*Edit#1:They are probably looking for a title other than those above that&apos;s why they haven&apos;t named it yet!who rated this? I mean seriously the second part isn&apos;t even out yet and people rated a book that is probably not even written yet!I think the cover of this book will have Erudite&apos;s or Abnegation&apos;s symbol on it!I am so exited freaking can&apos;t wait for it!!!Edit:me waiting......2Edit:I found this fan made cover on google isn&apos;t it amazing![image error]And this one is just freaking hilarious!Rimsha@Ramblings of a Bookworm
         
      ABNEGATION!
    
  
        
      I wish we could see the Candor compound. We will probably get to see the amity compound in Insurgent. An we&apos;ve already seen Abnegation, Dauntless, and Erudite. Where&apos;s Candor in this war??? And I&apos;m guessing either Abnegation..but he only problem is...how will they make it epic looking? The flames and swishing tree, but the hands of abnegation? how would that look totally epic without it look like just hands holding each other?
    
  
        
      It has been such a long time since i read Divergent so i have mostly forgotten a lot of details but i think that Veronica Roth is going o keep Candor in the background mostly maybe we will come to know something significant about them in the end of Insurgent that will lead them to be the main compound of the third book, or maybe they will stay in the background and abnegation will be the main compound since they are being attacked and all but who knows that&apos;s just a guess.And don&apos;t worry if Abnegation is going to be on the cover of Divergent#3 they will make it epic somehow, because Dauntless symbol is just fire in a ring they made it look so cool on the cover!
    
  
        
      I believe it will be Abnegation because at the end of Insurgent Tris talks about her parents by saying &quot;Abnegation to the end&quot;...
    
  
        
      yes of course but i posted that before Insurgent was out.. although i think that since its a trilogy maybe there won&apos;t be a faction symbol on the last book maybe there would be something else entirely or maybe the cover would have all the symbol&apos;s in it ...
    
  
        
      Loving these symbols! Where&apos;d you get them? But I don&apos;t reckon the cover will have any faction symbol, something new, something associated with outside the fence... Like the symbol for the people who did this to them or something like that.. You know, all that war Tris&apos; relation was talking bout on the video, well it sounded like the Nazi&apos;s! Don&apos;t you think? But Tris&apos;s world was too far advanced for the date to be back in WW2

I don&apos;t think that Nazi&apos;s are involved because they date way far back could be the modern Nazi&apos;s i do so hate the Nazi&apos;s but it will be pretty exciting to read about Tris blowing few Nazi&apos;s heads of ;D
    
  
        
      haha yea! that&apos;d be cool, but i can&apos;t wait to see what&apos;s outisde the fence!! :D
    
  
        
      neither can i ;)
    
  
        
      i hope its the abnegation symbol
    
  
        
      I love this series but honestly sometimes I get so bored but then when I stop reading I want to read it it&apos;s kind of like cake u have a small piece u tell your self you&apos;re done eating yet you want more. Btw I love the graphics lol
    
  
        
      I think the title for the third book will be convergent it sounds right with what happened at the end of book two
    
  
        
      Macky wrote: &quot;I love this series but honestly sometimes I get so bored but then when I stop reading I want to read it it&apos;s kind of like cake u have a small piece u tell your self you&apos;re done eating yet you want ...&quot;thanks Macky i know what you feel same situation here! And i think it could be convergent but the names Divergent and Convergent don&apos;t sound as cool as they did before because i just studied divergent and convergent in maths and maths is soo not cool!
    
  
        
      YAY! I&apos;m the one who made that fan-made cover. It&apos;s improved now! http://miguelm-c.tumblr.com/post/3238...

      LMAO I always wondered how books can already be rated before it&apos;s even done (: I think Mrs. Roth will do great on this last book, just like she did with the first two!

      Is there gonna be a movie
    
  
        
      My bet is the Abnegation symbol.

      the second part is out :) -- insurgent? :)
    
  
        
      ya the movies coming out in 2015 and ya y vote it if it hasnt come out even tho im sure it will b epic :)
    
  
        
      People vote it because they already know it&apos;s going to be da BOMB!
    
  
        
      The movie is scheduled for next year. They have casted Tris, Christina, Tori, and Caleb. Still no Four/Tobias. I know this because I have the official Divergent fanpage on Facebook. I have book three reserved already at Barnes and Noble. I can&apos;t wait! :)
    
  
        
      The next book&apos;s title is gonna be convergent ... just a hunch :P
    
  
        
      OH M G. If the next cover had the eye with fire in it, that&apos;d be SICK. And me and my friend Eileen from Singing and Reading in the Rain think the next books gonna be called RESURGENT!! :D It mean a renewal or coming-back. It makes sense in my opinion.
    
  
        
      Only 7 more months until it will finally be here not that I&apos;m counting... Jk I totally am.

      Actually the 2nd book is out, it&apos;s called Insurgent. I&apos;m thinking the 3rd book will probably have Erudite&apos;s symbol on it. Since the first book had Dauntless symbol I believe and the 2nd book had the Amity symbol.Ugh I&apos;m so excited for the book to come out!!!! :O
    
  
        
      OMG my friends and I r soooo exited about the release!!!!!!!!!
    
  
        
      In response to who may rate it before publication: advanced reader copies. They go out pre publication for the publishing company and author given to those who are part of ARC organizations! Great to get into if you review books regularly. It requires ARC members to write extensive reviews after reading!

           I understand why people are so upset with this book, but I personally thought this book was raw, realistic, and heartbreaking.
         
        
      I agree with you Jesse :)
    
  
        
      So true
    
  
        
      Agree. I went through a mourning period and I have accepted it. It was so true to the story.
    
  
        
      I actually think it&apos;s the best in the trilogy and I was beginning to think I was the only one. With all the hate on the internets...
    
  
        
      I agree whole-heartedly :) It was a realistic ending, and the only one that would&apos;ve made justice to the story :)
    
  
        
      definitely agree with you, Jesse. :)
    
  
        
      Not as scared to read it anymore! ;D
    
  
        
      I feel like an outlier for liking the book when a bunch of people are hating it, but I think you&apos;re right. It was a beautiful story. It was sad and I didn&apos;t like everything about it. Yet, I still enjoyed it.
    
  
        
      I agree!
    
  
        
      I agree :)
    
  
      I agree. I loved the world of Divergent, and I loved the characters and watching them grow. The message that Veronica was trying to share really stood out to me.
    
  
        
      I agree.The ending was perfect.There are rarely any fairy tale ending in real life.Somehow Tris dying makes the book so real.A happy ending doesn&apos;t make a book successfull it&apos;s how much it moves you that matters.I love Tris and she stayed true to her character.A perfect ending even though it was heartbreaking.
    
  
        
      so much agree with u its realistic dont know people why people dont understand it
    
  
        
      As the author, Veronica knows her characters and her story better than anyone. I understand most of us, readers, seek books to escape personal stress. So, I can totally see why people might get upset at this particular ending. However, I think by choosing to end the story the way she did, Veronica kept it realistic and mostly unpredictable. Let&apos;s be honest, this wasn&apos;t a romance novel. It was nice to have that romance feel to it in book one, but Veronica Roth isn&apos;t a romance writer. She proves that point really well by closing the way she did. I think Roth is a promising drama and dystopia writer. And that&apos;s perfectly fine by me. Yeah, there were so slow moments, but the ending was definitely not a complaint in my opinion.
    
  
        
      I agree with all my heart and it is almost broken softer seeing so many negative reviews for this book!
    
  
        
      *after
    
  
        
      Thank You For this review I will Actually Read it now *comes out from under rock* I wont be scared to read it.
    
  
        
      Finally! Someone who understands! This book was so realistic that the people who couldn&apos;t take that just wimped out and hated on Veronica! These books were literally life changing.....and I&apos;m not just saying that.
    
  
        
      This is EXACTLY how I felt (and feel) about Mockingjay while everyone else hates. It makes me more excited to read this one!
    
  
        
      You are so right. Even if the ending made me extremely sad it was still a fantastic book.
    
  
        
      I completely agree with this! I absolutely loved this book, no matter how sad it was. The ending was beautifully-tragic, and I can only thank Veronica for an amazing series that changed my life.
    
  
        
      Jesse yes!!! Its her world her characters and her story ! We decide to fall in love with it and we have to understand SHE controls the characters and it was the way it was supposed to end people ... DeAl with it!!! Hhhahaa love u
    
  
        
      Thank you for saying that because everyone is hating on it just because of the ending even though the ending makes sense(even though I am extremely upset about it and don&apos;t want it to be true) it is very realistic in this world and with these characters. I really liked this book, it was beautifully heart breaking.
    
  
        
      I think that&apos;s the problem. Veronica focused on the &quot;feels&quot;, and disregarded everything else. She produced nothing but an &quot;amateurish&quot; opportunistic book.
    
  
        
      I agree. There was a realistic look at loss and how differently it effects people. Even though the ending was incredibly sad (I cried), I was very surprised that she chose to end it that way. Despite most young adult novels ending in the same way, more or less, she went against the norm. It was new and refreshing. I don&apos;t see what everyone&apos;s issue is with it, except that maybe they didn&apos;t like the ending.
    
  
        
      This so much.
    
  
        
      well said. completely agree.
    
  
        
      Too many people are caught up with the typical &quot;happy endings&quot; to realize that not everything in life is all happy-go-lucky. Roth did a great job and I have no complaints whatsoever.
    
  
        
      totaly agree couldnt have said it better!
    
  
        
      that is so true. but i wish that she wasnt the one to die.
    
  
        
      I completely and utterly agree with you.
    
  
        
      I am going to read now after reading this thread. Its been on my kindle for two weeks. I think what I like about this trilogy has been that the world is bigger than the characters and so whatever happens, happens. I am diving in tonight. Thanks for this thread!
    
  
        
      i loved how different the book was from other books out their... so many people who are commenting are forgetting the word ...fiction.... what she did with this series was a rollarcoaster that i couldnt stop... andas for the ending...well i read alot of books and this was one of the most honest and truley the best ending of my reading list....
    
  
        
      thanks for your review and this thread, I don&apos;t feel so alone anymore in loving the entire series, including Allegiant. Though extremely heartbreaking, personally, I think the ending fit the entire series&apos; theme/story that&apos;s why I accepted it. The entire Divergent series was a total roller coaster of love/hate emotions and yet I enjoyed every bit of it.p.s. i put a link of this review and thread on my own review so that when my friends finally read it, they won&apos;t also feel alone, if ever they liked how the Allegiant ended, too.
    
  
        
      I agree. The book was nothing like what people said. It was well thought out and the ending made sense over all. The only thing I didn&apos;t like was the two perspectives. It got really confusing.
    
  
        
      I agree with you Kelly! I&apos;m glad I&apos;m not the only one who got confused. I loved the ending though...or maybe not LOVED but I respect the ending and I can see how perfect it is.
    
  
        
      agree, i wanted to say i hated it cause i was in tears, but i realized it was cause i loved it so much.. loved her so much.. damn I&apos;m feel empty and euphoria when i think of it.. i love it! Four owns my heart ♥
    
  
        
      I agree, it was a great book and the pain was raw and realistic and Tris and Tobias&apos; love was heartbreaking and beautiful and honest. I&apos;m just super upset about how the ending played out.
    
  
        
      Agreed!
    
  
        
      It&apos;s good to see that for once a great trilogy hasn&apos;t taken the easy way out. The heartbreak is really the only way it could have ended.
    
  
        
      finally someone who is not cursing out for killing Tris in the last book.I admit I was angryat first but then thought about it and yeah Tris is brave. A brilliant ending. dont u agree :)
    
  
        
      I didn&apos;t want it to happen, but I knew it would from the beginning of the book. Why else would it switch point of views when the other books hadn&apos;t? And I could be okay with it, except that the author, in the entire series, took away love. Did she leave anyone who loved each other besides family love? Maybe Zeke and Shauna - were they together? I guess it is consistent throughout, but I like to think that love can last between two people. But every couple died, or at least one of them did, suggesting that the only people you can count on is family, and not even them all of the time. I just finished the last book so maybe it&apos;s just my book hangover talking, but I guess I would have like some relationship to survive.
    
  
        
      yay esp Tris and Four because i feel soo sorry for Four finally he found someone to spend his life with. then it gets taken away. yeah i was pissed esp when Uriah died coz i loved his character so much :)btw i have read the series twice
    
  
        
      I agree. :&apos;)
    
  
        
      I dont think i hate the ending because it wasnt raw or realistic. I hate it because throught out the book they were the sense of hope amoung all of this hurt and pain and i held on to that. And it breaks my heart because i dont agree that is what Tris deserved or wanted. It was an honorable way to die and it is nice to see a women die for what she believes, but it would be even more beautiful to see her live for what she believes. Oh and spare my heart! lollolloll. But she is the writer and it is her final decision and i still adore the other two books. 
    
  
        
      Thank u, your officially my cyber best friend. I wrote another comment similar to yours
    
  
        
      I am sorry. But I can&apos;t agree. It isn&apos;t even the ending that I hated, it was how it was written. She destroyed the characters, dismantled the plot, and made everything pointless. Anyone with any little bit about how genetics even works understands that it made no sense. She left so many holes in the plot. Nothing even made any sense. I am not against the main character dying but she made her die for a pointless reason. And when she made it with two different views, it was obvious she did it so the story could continue after Tris&apos;s death. But she did it terrible. She made Tobias and Tris sound exactly the same. One suppose to be a girl and one suppose to be a brave guy. She turned Tobias into a little girl! And the whole solving of the issue in Chicago was lame. Tobias asks&quot;mommy, please be my mommy again&quot; and poof she no longer is this crazy psycho killer. What the heck happened!
    
  
        
      I felt the same way. I truly love that Veronica Roth choose to stick with what she believe her characters would do instead of letting the fans play a part in her writing. Which I thought brought the story more life and made it that much more incredible to read.
    
  
        
      Why does everyone say Tris dies for a pointless reason. I think she died for a perfect reason, she died to protect her brother Celeb even though she was angry at him for betraying her. Yes she promised she wouldnt kill herself to Tobais but she died for the ones she love, not alot of people do that. I think it was amazing that she put Tobais Pov into the book, Because in the first 2 books he was as you quote The Brave Guy, but not every is strong, i think it was time too see a little bit of Tobias, his fellings and how he adapted to what happened, of course he going to run to his mother because he hasnt seen her, what so bad in that, everyone have feelings even the most ruthless, so i think Roth did an amazing job, this one made me understand alot more about Divergent. and dont you think it was nice to see them in the real world, you learned a heap about Tris mother and where she came from.so i do not agree wtih you, but i am not judging you its ur opinion.

      Just the genetics part maybe wasn&apos;t so realistic... XD

           Veronica Roth:Well, I tried writing this review without there being any spoilers, but it’s rather impossible – for me, at least. So, readers beware.Veronica can do so much better than this, so so much. The second Tobias’ PoV was introduced I knew Tris was going to pull some heroic sacrificial bullshit and get her ass killed. I fucking knew it. Not a tear was shed from me… not a single fuck was given. Yes, dear readers, call me a Satanist slash sadist for all I care. I saw no point in this move – perhaps Roth wanted to be unique and inspiring with her story; nevertheless, it was still unnecessary. Apart from that, Allegiant is an entirely different story, entirely different. The book was confusing. I wasn’t pissed whilst reading, I wasn’t saddened, hell, I wasn’t even bored. I was reading this book with a blank expression. Constantly I kept forgetting I was reading a book that’s a continuance of the Divergent trilogy. The terms “Divergent” and “Divergence” were a reminder that I was, indeed, reading the final installment. I’m sorry to say this, but: this was the dumbest book I’ve read in 2013. Allegiant was a hot ass fucking mess. The character development as well as the world-building was tragic. It was not explained how Tris survived the death serum, we were only given half-assed, clouded ideas. The romance fell off a cliff and shattered on sharp rocks at the bottom, the relationship between Tris and Tobias failed to impress me. The whole BOOK failed to impress me. It hurts me to say this because I adore Veronica Roth. No one, and I mean no one can change my mind about this book: you can write a mile long essay about why you felt this book was perfectly wrapped and poignant, you can say how wrong I am, you can say just about anything and I still wouldn&apos;t give a flying Ford Anglia.I remember Roth wrote a blog post about wanting Harry Potter to be killed off because &quot;it would have showed the greatest act of sacrifice and love&quot;. I don&apos;t know what her fucking deal is with killing people off because &quot;it shows real love&quot;. No, it doesn&apos;t. That&apos;s not always the route to take; there are other ways of showing true love and sacrifice. There&apos;s always another way. The minute the characters went out the fence, the story fell even further into the pit of stupidity. Allegiant tried to be preachy. The government (or should I say the Bureau) in here plays (or is) God. We are introduced to superfluous explanations on why we have the factions and the factionless. We learn about Genetic Purity and the Genetically Damaged. Genetic Purity meaning Divergence; Genetically Damaged meaning belonging to one faction with fucked up genes. We also find out Tobias is, in fact, not Divergent, but Genetically Damaged which gives Allegiant, yet, ANOTHER twist that&apos;s pointless with dramatic arguments. Come the fuck ON. I am not impressed. OH, how can I forget? Tris&apos; mother was part of this Bureau. HOW FUCKING EXCITING OMFG!!1!!11!!! /sarcasmWhat else do you want to throw in to make this all the more amazing and special?Honest to God I wish I had something nice to say about Allegiant. There&apos;s an attempt at a love triangle here between Nita and Tobias, there&apos;s an attempt at something unique with this story, but the alternating PoV between Tris and Tobias and everything I&apos;ve stated above ruined everything. Also, I didn&apos;t like Tobias&apos; voice here, Roth did not do a good job with portraying a male protagonist. I kept hearing a female voice in my head, constantly thinking it was Tris&apos;. Did Veronica have this all planned out since the first book? If it was then it wasn&apos;t very good and thorough. This book is a flat out FAIL.
         
        
      It&apos;s been announced that Theo James will play Tobias. He&apos;s no Liam, but still swoon worthy.
    
  
        
      aw man. Eh, I guess he&apos;ll do; my sister is going to throw a fit LOL.
    
  
        
      I said that exact thing, Liam Hemsworth just looks like he&apos;d be Four.
    
  
        
      Right? I&apos;m disappointed. But I&apos;m so glad to know my sister and I aren&apos;t the only ones that feel this way.
    
  
        
      Actually Theo James is much closer to what I imagined Four to look like in the books. I can&apos;t imagine Shailene Woodley as Tris though... I feel pretty disappointed about that.
    
  
        
      BAHAHAHHAHAAHAH THOSE GIFS. ESPECIALLY THE I&apos;M DONE HAHAHAHAH
    
  
        
      juiliet you dream has come true! Theo james is cast as 4!
    
  
        
      I dont know, it would bother me a little if Liam Hemsworth played Four.... I mean, he&apos;s Gale. I think somebody else should play him, and would Shailene Woodley Dye her hair blonde for the role?
    
  
        
      Isn&apos;t Tris supposed to be short and not pretty?
    
  
        
      Kay wrote: &quot;Isn&apos;t Tris supposed to be short and not pretty?&quot;I think she&apos;s supposed to be a unique kind of pretty. She really doesnt think she&apos;s pretty, but when a does a character who is telling their own story say &apos;Hey Im a really good looking person&quot; almost never. It&apos;s hard to like a character who talks about how good they look. And Tris is a character that we kind of need to like and root for.

The writing for that show is so bad, it makes it hard to tell who&apos;s a good actor and who&apos;s a bad actor.
    
  
        
      I don&apos;t mind her at all. I think she&apos;ll play the part perfectly. She was picked for a reason. ;)
    
  
        
      LIAM NEEDS TO PLAY FOUR!!! :( But they picked Theo James to play our Four...DANGIT!!!
    
  
        
      Each of those series you mentioned is shorter than the last, too. Harry Potter: 7 books, Twilight: 4 books....Divergent: 3 books. Bummer, huh? lol
    
  
        
      ...Omg you&apos;re so right! o.O
    
  
        
      The movie is going to suck... It&apos;s gunna be just another hunger games where people watch the movie and the that is what they think the book should be.I might be alone on this one, but, the movie tris looks nothing like book tris to me because Veronica Roth couldn&apos;t emphasize enough that tris is not pretty without actually saying in the book &quot;Seriously, Tris is not pretty WHATSOEVER! She has no better side and she still is pretty ugly from all angles and light.&quot;She Just doesnt fit the bill to me... :(
    
  
        
      I wouldn&apos;t jump to conclusions, maybe it is, maybe it isn&apos;t. But the author herself said the adaptation was amazing, so that&apos;s saying something. Though I do understand where you&apos;re coming from about tris being ugly, but I think Shailene would do a good job playing the role. :)
    
  
        
      Thanks, I understand what your trying to say. If Veronica Roth is happy ,then, I will try to be happy too ^_^.

      There&apos;s a movie?! Is it out yet? woohoo!
    
  
        
      Yes, and no it&apos;s not (I wish!). It&apos;ll be released next year in the USA March 21, 2014. :)
    
  
        
      Do you know what it&apos;s going to be rated?
    
  
        
      No, I don&apos;t. but check IMDB
    
  
        
      Omg. Did no one else think Four was African-American? O___O
    
  
        
      Hahaha umm.... no? :p
    
  
        
      The still of Tris jumping off the roof = exactly what I saw when I read it.
    
  
        
      This film is going to be off the chain
    
  
        
      I have another series that I think you would be interested in...I liked it much better than twilight and I love all those same series you mentioned. I liked twilight but man that last book just didn&apos;t bring it all together very well. Anyway, so this series i am recommending, I read them a long time ago and I might be a bit late in telling you now that there is a movie coming out...but if you have the time to read it I would HIGHLY recommend the mortal instruments series. And its companion series the infernal devices.
    
  
        
      (Looks around nervously)... Fallyn, about the Mortal Instruments series.... Review #1Review #2Review #3TMI series and I didn&apos;t get along like I hoped.But I did enjoy the Infernal Devices! Read all three books. Clockwork Princess had me sobbing.
    
  
        
      Normally the last book in any series rips out my heart and spears it on a trident, leaves me gasping like a fish out of the water, blinds me, and has me thinking, &quot;what just happened?!&quot; (e.g.: Forever, Boundless, Clockwork Princess, Mockingjay...). So now I have last-book-in-the-series-phobia. And Allegiant is the last book...Please let Allegiant have a happy ending.
    
  
        
      LOL, same here!I hope so, too. But after reading this (Here) I&apos;m extremely anxious and can&apos;t stop biting nails.
    
  
        
      OMG, I can see Liam Hemsworth playing Four.......I wish he wasn&apos;t with the Hunger Games Movies........ But Theo James is a GREAT PICK TOO, I was like 
    
  
        
      I know I&apos;m EXCITED!!!!!!! (Jazz Hands)
    
  
        
      40 days to go! I&apos;m freaking excited!!!
    
  
        
      ME TOO OMG
    
  
        
      I just saw a 5 min. interview on youtube with Shailene Woodley and Theo James. Having a very hard time imagining those two having the conversation in Divergent where Four and Tris talk about their virginity.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t25LAo... is the link to the Woodley / James comic-con interview. The two of them could work as Tris and Four, but the virginity scene should be deleted imho, and also the writers should set up the story in such a way that people choose their faction at age 21, not 16, because neither of the actors look like teenagers.
    
  
        
      LMFAO, do you have a link to the interview? I need to re-read Divergent because I forgot about that conversation.

The two of them could work as Four and Tris, but the virginity scene should be deleted imho, and also the writers should set up the story in such a way that people choose their faction at age 21, not 16, because neither of the actors look like teenagers.
    
  
        
      Haha, you&apos;ve got a point about Theo James not looking 16, I think Woodley could slide. However, having the age of choosing the faction at 21 defuses the whole purpose of it being Dystopia, IMO. Age 16 is perfect given the fact that the environment is a complete disaster and people are living in fear that the world wouldn&apos;t last much longer so the age limit of being considered an adult is lowered.We&apos;ll see how this talk of virginity will play out when Divergent is released in theatres; if it&apos;s not something that people like, then when it comes out to DVD the scene should be removed.Thanks for the link!
    
  
        
      Veronica is an epic authors and thank you so bad because her make me being stunned and amazed in the same timebut,i&apos;m still hoping summit will do somethinh about the ending of allegiant the movie.
    
  
        
      Lovely review, but I have to admit Roth is right about Harry Potter should die in the final book, not because his dying shows &apos;real love&apos; but because it makes a lot of sense.
    
  
        
      Thank you, Mizuki! ^.^ Really? I can sort of see where Roth was coming from about HP, but then again I thought Jo wrapped up the Deathly Hallows beautifully with an explanation on why it is the way it is. I can accept that.
    
  
        
      AWESOME REVIEW! This book was a MAJOR FAIL!Never going to read anything written by Roth again.
    
  
        
      Thank you! :D It sadly was. Honestly, if Roth writes a new book, I will definitely read it. She&apos;s a great writer, it&apos;s just this book that&apos;s a major fail. I know she can do a lot better than this so I&apos;ll give her future works a shot.
    
  
        
      I simply refuse to read anything written by her. She has broken my heart. Have you heard? She&apos;s writing a new book from Four&apos;s POV before he met Tris and it&apos;s going to release in July 2014. Honestly, I&apos;m not interested.
    
  
        
      Aw :( I&apos;m sorry that happened. No, I won&apos;t be reading that one because Tobias&apos; PoV isn&apos;t done well. I cannot hear a male voice, I hear Tris&apos; and that&apos;s a horrible thing. If she writes something else that&apos;s not from the Divergent world I&apos;ll read it.
    
  
        
      Since I loved Divergent, I&apos;ll watch the movie but I&apos;ll make sure not to spend even a dollar from my pocket for it.
    
  
        
      Oh I&apos;m not going to watch it at all -- paying or watching it online. Nope.
    
  
        
      You&apos;re on it! Thanks for saying all of the words that just won&apos;t make it past my lips. I was not at all pleased with this book. Totally different ballgame. So disappointing.

      Your photoshop skills are crazy good! I use photoshop too and I can&apos;t get even close to what you&apos;ve done with this cover of yours. xD I better buff up my experience with tutorials.
    
  
        
      Thank you! Yes, tutorials also helped me a lot. Believe me, If only I can show you my first Photoshop work *facepalm* Just keep practicing, and remember: HAVE FUN!
    
  
        
      love your cover. could be a good idea for book 4 where tris is not dead after all but was resurrected. lol Not entirely impossible considering how Amar and George and other divergents were not dead, after all. She could have been serve by the rising rebels from the fringe. If I had talent as a writer, I&apos;d write it for your cover. lol If only to cheer up my little sister who took the ending so badly she refused to read any more YA trilogies until she read the ending first.
    
  
        
      But none of her covers used human features. Mostly nature stuff. Wouldn&apos;t make sense to start now.
    
  
        
      Wow so cool!
    
  
        
      It&apos;s amazing!
    
  
        
      omygod thats so creative well done!
    
  
        
      I know this sounds weird, but maybe that should be the 4th book..... I just can&apos;t live with the series ending like that!
    
  
        
      Awesome cover

           Obviously, I just don&apos;t get it.What a Divergent fan apparently sees:531 pages of awesome!And what I see:Faction crap. Faction crap. Faction crap. Tris and Four. Faction crap. Faction crap. Tris and Four. Some nonsense with genetics. Faction crap. Wtf moment. The end. ~Admittedly, I&apos;ve always been a skeptic of Veronica Roth&apos;s books - Divergent was nonsense dressed up as a dystopian, Insurgent pretty much failed at everything except piling on the bullshit - but, as I predicted in my Insurgent review, there was just something about Roth&apos;s end game that had me curious. Something I thought I&apos;d either love or absolutely despise. Well, after finishing Allegiant, I think I&apos;ve finally figured out why these books never clicked for me like they have for a lot of other people - Veronica Roth has some really good ideas and a good message, but the way she constructs her world to develop that message is just so heavy handed to the point the whole thing ends up flying in the face of common sense.Here&apos;s the thing, Divergent as a series is built around one very simple, very obvious proposition: we should all be treated as individuals rather than stereotyped into some faction, Dauntless or Erudite or Candor (except Roth&apos;s doing the stereotyping anyway, like what&apos;s up with only the Erudite wearing glasses?). Don&apos;t believe me? That&apos;s straight up paraphrased from one of Tris&apos;s many lines to Four. The idea itself gets no argument from me, not when it&apos;s like one of those universal truths only a douche could disagree with, but, problem is, rather than writing the kind of story that makes me want to believe it, Roth writes the kind of story that so obviously shoves it down my throat in the most unpleasant way possible it hurts - starting with the whole faction system, which, at the risk of sounding repetitive, makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.Now, I&apos;m not saying for a fictional book everything has to make perfect sense, but in this case, it&apos;s not so much that the factions make no sense (even after all the mumbo jumbo experimental crap Roth&apos;s concocted to force some logic onto the system - crap I saw coming ever since Insurgent&apos;s out of nowhere ending) as much as the factions are so obviously written the way they are to reinforce Roth&apos;s message of how stereotyping is bad that they make no sense outside of that context. In other words, Roth needs them so Tris can repeatedly tell me how everyone should be judged for who they are rather than for which faction they belong to (or, as is the case later on in this one, rather than for how their genes are), and not because the factions do anything for the whole exploration of human nature thing everyone tells me this book is really supposed to be about. Maybe that&apos;s not a flaw for anyone else, but as I see it, the whole thing is just a critique of a straw man spread out over three books padded by filler to make the straw man&apos;s existence nominally logical but not really, and that for me is the ultimate waste of time.Nowhere is any of this more obvious than with the whole genetically damaged versus pure thing Roth&apos;s got going throughout the middle of this one. I hate to say it, but the damaged versus pure storyline is even worse than the regular faction A versus faction B storyline we&apos;ve had for two books now, not only because it&apos;s basically the same thing she&apos;s been trying to sell for two books now only now a hundred times more obvious what she&apos;s doing (People are unique! The status quo is bad!), but also because to cover up how shoddily constructed THAT backstory is we&apos;ve had to pile on even more bullshit and crap to hand wave it away that the whole thing falls apart like a house of straw anyway and the only thing left is a good idea surrounded by a whole lotta nonsense to validate it. I mean, the whole genes personality persecution angle? What? Does it make sense outside of Tris saying how people shouldn&apos;t be persecuted based on their genes? And doesn&apos;t it get on anyone else&apos;s nerves that Tris is always right, &apos;the system&apos; is always wrong, yet despite how bad everything is certain characters still want things to stay the way they are? For apparently no reason whatsoever? Yeah. No.Basically, I only liked two things - Tris and Caleb&apos;s relationship, and the ballsy ending (for like five seconds). For a last book so artificial most of it is spent on (poorly done) exposition to explain it all away, Tris and Caleb to me felt like the only thing real about any of it, the one character development success in a sea of plot development failure. And the ending, in retrospect, was the one last Hail Mary that could&apos;ve done anything for the book, because let&apos;s be real, the fate of the factions was so tediously mired in poorly done backstory segueing into genetic nonsense the rest of this wasn&apos;t going to do much of anything anyway, so how else was Allegiant going to end with a bang? Too bad that&apos;s all it does though. Bang. Now go wonder how the heck all the pointlessness managed to get swept under a rug. While telling yourself how a better book wouldn&apos;t have had to resort to such a cheap tactic. Bottom line, look, I admire creative world building, but it has to be organic, not so obviously constructed for the heroine to score sympathy points for being obviously right that there&apos;s just no payoff when the artificial construct&apos;s finally destroyed - finishing Allegiant feels like ending a pointless exercise that went nowhere.
         
        
      I see you are back, with a vengeance :)))
    
  
        
      I haven&apos;t seen you around in a while. It&apos;s nice you&apos;re back. :)I am actually skipping this because I cannot put up with anymore disappointing books. I saw the spoiler and everything so at least I know what I would be missing (which isn&apos;t much apparently).
    
  
        
      yay, another person not in love with this series.
    
  
        
      Good to see you back!Not going to bother with the series then lol.
    
  
        
      I expected something different too.
    
  
        
      I&apos;m glad I follow a few people that have really disliked this book. Saves me the trouble of reading it and being disappointed.
    
  
        
      tried to read the first chapter, can&apos;t get into it
    
  
        
      Yeah I&apos;m back.

      I didn&apos;t even make it past the first book. It just felt tired and disconnected. Glad I didn&apos;t continue because it seems I haven&apos;t missed anything.
    
  
        
      Yeah, I don&apos;t think you&apos;re missing much.
    
  
        
      Mitch- (view spoiler)[ ... It was a game changer indeed.. and she had it planned like from the beginning which kind of pisses me off  (hide spoiler)]
    
  
        
      can someone message me what the game changer was? I&apos;m curious - but not enough to want to read it.
    
  
        
      Haha! Loved this review! I admit Divergent had a bunch of flaws to begin with but I was willing to look past that because I was so invested in Tris&apos;s journey through Dauntless initiation (hey, everyone loves and underdog, right?) and I always (stupidly) assumed that things would be explained in later books and that the lacklustre writing would improve. Nope. In the end, I think the last two books in the series get worse and worse and ultimately collapsed under the weight of it&apos;s own stupidity. That may be harsh, but that&apos;s really the most concise way I can express how I feel about this series as a whole.
    
  
        
      well, fuck. :/Definitely not reading your review till I&apos;m done.
    
  
        
      (view spoiler)[ Tris fucking dies? Dx  (hide spoiler)]I wasn&apos;t going to read your review but I thought the comments would be harmless. Apparently not while you&apos;re on GR app. I&apos;m a little mad at GR and their wretched app that doesn&apos;t hide spoilers by default and a little devastated at having such a big plot twist/end revealed before even starting the book. :&apos;(
    
  
        
      Read the spoiler... Ugh, I don&apos;t think I&apos;m ever finishing it.
    
  
        
      You should finish it, I saw the ending coming a mile off (10% before it happened). It&apos;s better to make your own judgements. I didn&apos;t hate the ending.
    
  
        
      Blah...Why do you always make sense??
    
  
        
      In retrospect, the status quo is never right. But I see your point.
    
  
        
      i completely agree! &gt;.&lt;
    
  
        
      I enjoyed your review. I have not read any of your other reviews but I felt this one hit the mark. I&apos;m glad I am not the only one disenchanted by this book.
    
  
        
      I hated Insurgent (too forced, repetitive, and just clearly only around to set up the 3rd book) and was really hoping Allegiant would be much better...but it&apos;s the same old repetitive stuff. This whole series should have been 1 book. I&apos;m like 10% in and just can&apos;t bring myself to read the whole thing. It&apos;s just so boring.
    
  
        
      I agree with you guys, the book did have a sucky ending, but I don&apos;t get why all you people are bashing Veronica Roth. She&apos;s a great author. The story has a message and you guys just don&apos;t seem to get it. Don&apos;t get me wrong I&apos;m not bashing you guys either, but I just don&apos;t get why a lot of people hate the books SO MUCH. I loved them.
    
  
        
      That&apos;s not true. Veronica Roth did NOT betray her fan base by not giving her story a cookie-cutter ending &amp; letting Tris live to have monuments built in her honor. She stayed true to the character in that one aspect, the only redeeming quality for that last book. Was it sad? No. Did it continue too long after Tris&apos; death? Eff yes, it did. But a story is an organic thing &amp; just because it&apos;s not the ending you wanted doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s not the right ending. I hope Hollywood cleans up the nonsensical last two books &amp; that&apos;s it. They don&apos;t need to change endings &amp; they definitely don&apos;t need to tie everything up with a bow. War is messy &amp; that&apos;s what happened in this series... just with a little less to go on than even the most asinine real life battle.
    
  
        
      Finally someone gets it!
    
  
        
      great review.
    
  
        
      I LOVED the first book. Devoured it. Read until three int he morning kind of loved it. The second one&apos;s last fifty pages or so made up for the mediocrity of the beginning half. But I hated this last one, and not because of the ending.

There were so many other issues with the book (from what I&apos;ve read in the reviews) aside from the ending. And it isn&apos;t that we all wanted a happy ending (although to expect one isn&apos;t wrong either) she just went about it the wrong way. H
    
  
        
      Love your reviews bro. I couldnt make it more than 30 pages into the second one before deleting it, so you are a braver man than me.
    
  
        
      The AV Club wrote a review with pretty much the same sentiment.
    
  
        
      the first two books were good the fist was the best ,but the last completely ruined the whole sereis
    
  
        
      Read only the 1st one and knew the series would go up in flames instantaneously. It&apos;s garbage. Really it is. Too corny. It&apos;s all been done before by other authors... Who did a better job of it. Terrible trilogy. Really, really terrible
    
  
        
      I don&apos;t think I even need to write a review after this one. You said it all.
    
  
        
      I read the first book and thought &apos; oh this is actually going to be an entertaining series for the most part&apos; come the second book and I could barely bring myself to read it and I get through my books quickly. I was told to read this series by so many people saying read it, its a really good book but I could barely bring myself to read it and am disappointed because I heard so many good things only to be like what a waste of time. the idea was good but really just the way she wrote it and how she wrote about everything was really sad because j ended up skipping a lot of parts. I agree with you but still I am expected to read it I will be skimming a lot to get it over with.
    
  
        
      This is for Roth to read, even though I know she won&apos;t, I just want to put it out there: There&apos;s a way to write a character death. It has to be done right, it has to be believable, you&apos;ve got to build up to it (no spontaneous deaths, please!) in order for it to work, and you need a fulfilling conclusion afterward. Readers need to feel that there&apos;s hope for the characters that survive. You need to get the readers to believe that what you did was best for the story. I&apos;ve read books where the authors have killed off the main characters, but these deaths felt hopeful, fulfilling. They did what was best for the story. That&apos;s all there is to it.
    
  
        
      The beginning of this review made me laugh. Thanks!
    
  
        
      Why would you read the third book if you didn&apos;t like the first two? Do you have a lot of time to waste or what?

      Oh come on man the book may have made not that much sense in the beginning but after a while it was under standable but you just jump on criticizing it and i gave it time and made me think and you shouldnt be like this you can do better.

      Divergent= Very well written and brilliantly executed...Insurgent= Don&apos;t know what&apos;s going on and why people are doing random things for no reason .....Allegiant= Existential Despair.... Ending, which tried to be tragic was BULLS*T.... Slow...... Then Build up....... Again Slow........ And now some Random genetics SH*T.... Don&apos;t know why they are doing things which they aren&apos;t supposed to do.......... Stop reading this series at Insurgent people.......
    
  
        
      Well, you&apos;re right about something : don&apos;t read the last two books, people.

      go tris
    
  
        
      I completely agree with you. Why kill the protagonist? I understand it was suppose to symbolize something but I am seriously upset by Roth&apos;s actions. I mean I can kind of see what she was trying to accomplish. Her final choice defined her as the selfless abnegation she always was, and the brave dauntless she became. However, I just can&apos;t get over the fact that the main protagonist was killed off.
    
  
        
      mrs roth: you personally had hundreds of readers who loved your first 2 books. no 3 HOWEVER is a completely different story. why the jeebies did you kill of tris.WHY?????
    
  
        
      The best part of this review is the gold star. Love it!!! You summed up the mess so well:)
    
  
        
      You see Faction crap because this book based on factions and Tris and Four. You can&apos;t blame anyone
    
  
        
      I was curious about this series and read the first book. It was interesting. I tried the second and just couldn&apos;t do it. Like you though I wanted to know what was going to happen without having to actually wade through it all. I ended up going online and finding a synopsis and just reading that. So glad I did lol!

           I have no doubt that this book damaged me, psychologically, as a small child. It is one of the earliest books I vividly remember reading aloud to myself, and I remember the first time my mother read it to me before she put me to bed. Here&apos;s the gist of the plot: A little boy named Max dresses up in a wolf costume, plays with a hammer, chases his dog with a fork, then threatens to cannibalize his mother. His mother, a master of irony, then puts him to bed with no dinner. Already, this story should start creeping you out. Then a forest starts to grow in Max&apos;s bedroom. And no, no chemicals have been ingested anywhere in the story. Though the bit about chasing the dog with the fork does imply a delusional state. Regardless, a fucking forest grows in the kids bedroom. So naturally he gets in a boat and sails off to the other side of the world, to where all these &quot;wild things&quot; are. And promptly subjugates everyone he sees. I&apos;m a damn toddler, and my mom is reading me a book about a sociopath. So Max has a ball with this gang he&apos;s conquered and converted, and they howl at the moon and hop through trees. Then he gets hungry and goes home, where his mother, no doubt terrified of his new army of foreign creatures, has left his food for him, still warm. I thought, &quot;This woman aims to do me harm.&quot; Yes, please, mother. Read me a story about my bedroom becoming a forest inhabited by monsters, then put me to bed. Think I slept that night? No, I hid out under my bed with a plastic baseball bat, a water gun and flashlight, hoping to God that if this was the night it all went wrong, I had the courage to look those monsters in the eye and pretend I wasn&apos;t wetting myself. I made a nest with a giant teddy bear and two pillows and didn&apos;t come out until the next morning, when I heard my mom coming down the hall. All day long I pretended nothing was different. But I asked her to read me Where The Wild Things Are again that night. And the next night. For months. I would ask her questions like &quot;Do you think I will have my monsters get you if you don&apos;t make me supper?&quot; And she&apos;d smile, and say &quot;Go to bed, Nathan.&quot; Spooky shit, I&apos;m telling you. I learned to read through fear and intimidation. A subversive masterpiece. NC
         
        
      Haha! Brilliant review!
    
  
        
      Its funny how real-life sociopaths are always searching for &quot;what went wrong&quot; when they were kids. So cute of you to follow suit. Though it is kind of a Catch-22 (Mr. Heller) if you actually care enough to try to understand your being a sociopath....hehe
    
  
        
      You&apos;re right. I should search for &quot;what went right&quot; instead. It&apos;d take less effort. Anyway, what do you know about sociopaths? You drive a lime-green VW bug.NC

      Dude, my review was supposed to be ironic. Maybe even funny. (Though maybe not, apparently.) It was my all-time favorite book as a kid. I loved it. I still do. Happy?
    
  
        
      yes....thank you
    
  
        
      I too remember reading this as a kid. I absolutely adored your review. It made me laugh several times. Thanks for sharing!
    
  
        
      I liked your review. I have been thinking for sometime to actually read it. Since now it is coming to the theaters this month. I have never even heard of this book until last year. After reading your review makes me want to read it even more and share it with my daugher....although she might not like it. but she is known to surprise me. Thanks for the laugh too in your review.
    
  
        
      Great review!!!!! With the movie coming out, my friend and I were talking about reading this book as kids. We both loved it, but it scared me silly. She didn&apos;t understand. I am now going to send her this review. :) Thanks for a good laugh and some confirmation that I am not the only one who was scared by this book as a kid!

      Lovely review, I was worried about the dark undertones in this book, now I know it will be safe to read to my three year old, and if he turns out a sociopath we will know the truth about why.
    
  
        
      This is the first book I learned how to read, too! Even though it scared the heck out of me, I will always cherish it for the memories I have associated with Where The Wild Things Are. I am definitely reading this to my kids!
    
  
        
      Sir, you made me laugh. Brilliant review!

      Nathan, I see your review as a serious Pulitzer contender. It&apos;s an amazing piece of art in itself. Ben, please. Your unwittingly termed imagination is simply what society expected you to imagine. They divided feelings into the boy and girl sects, and you followed. Nothing beyond that, or else the mighty threat of being shunned. You probably even liked teddies as a toddler, but then as you grew up-&quot;You&apos;re expected to do better than play with teddies, &apos;boy&apos; &quot;.My point being, there&apos;s nothing wrong with boys being sensitive and there&apos;s nothing wrong with girls being stoic. The only problem lies with the thinking of the people unable to grab this simple idea.Oh don&apos;t mind me, I just had a bad day. Hope you gain from it and pay heed.
    
  
        
      I love books
    
  
        
      Don&apos;t u people and love God ok people
    
  
        
      I totally agree the images in the book is kind of disturbing especially seeing a little boy next to the monster doesn&apos;t sit well with me .
    
  
        
      This app is also for kids so if I were you I would watch your mouth

           This book is crap, and let me tell you why. The kid is a jerk and is sent to his room without supper. He proceeds to go to some magical place where these monsters live and he bosses them around and is mean to them. Then he gets back home...having not learned that being a mean jerk is wrong...and there on his table in his room is dinner...and it&apos;s still warm. What&apos;s the lesson here exactly? Hate the book.
         
        
      i remember when i was leeetle, i loved the pictures and oh-so-desperately wanted to learn how to read it.then i did. and i thought the same exact thing. the monsters should&apos;ve eaten him.
    
  
        
      Being a beast and a wild thing is tiresome to those around you. That is the lesson. Also, no matter how much trouble you have caused, those that truly love you will always love you. 
    
  
        
      disagree. the book is wonderful. you seemed to have missed the lesson entirely. i cannot express my take on the book better than the above comment. thankyou.
    
  
        
      This book is about unconditional love.
    
  
        
      i think the harsh comments about max being cannabalistic towards his mother, and chasing his dog with a fork are a little much. this book is about being a kid. its a fun book. the &quot;wild things&quot; in the book is to represent all the people around him, normally. its about love. i think you might have had some kind of childhood haunting, because especially now, i certainly dont have any recollection of being upset by this book.

      Obviously the suggestion that the book is crap and that the monsters should have eaten Max belong to those who do not have children their own. It&apos;s about a child learning to manage his emotions and the unconditional love a child needs in order to learn this tricky skill. Maybe it was your parents who damaged you and not the book! :)
    
  
        
      I&apos;m wondering the same thing.what exactly do children learn from this book?being a jerk to your mom,becoming the king of the most scariest things and then coming back home to find everything alright.where&apos;s the morality and what&apos;s the point?
    
  
        
      I&apos;ve been a school teacher for ten years, and I&apos;ve met soooo many children like Max, their parens are completly lost,they don&apos;t know what to do with them but they spect teachers and therapists solve the problem =S

So because your cousine (not even sure what the heck a &apos;cousine&apos; is) loves this book everyone else should to right? Are you 5 years old? Do you have any working brain cells?I should have guessed - this came from someone who gave A Million Little Pieces (Lies) five stars. Who&apos;d a thunk it?
    
  
        
      I gave this books 3 stars for the same reasons as the author of this review.It is a fun book about the power of imagination, with interesting illustrations... but Max is a bit of a jerk! I mean, he&apos;s ready to stab his own dog (I&apos;m assuming it&apos;s not some stray that somehow got into his house) with a fork!He does eventually realize that being mean and monstrous all the time gets boring and isn&apos;t really worth missing dinner and home - but that lesson is left to the parents reading the book to explain to their child.Not every child&apos;s story has to be Aesop&apos;s fables with clear-cut lessons spelled-out for you at the end, but would it have hurt Sendak to have Max apologize to his Mom (or thank her for keeping his dinner hot for him)?If the parent is reading this book to their child and presenting the proper lesson, it&apos;s a 4- or 5-star book. If not (either the kid reads it on his own or someone reads it without making sure the correct lesson is learned), it&apos;s a 2- or 1-star book.Hence my 3-star rating.
    
  
        
      There doesn&apos;t have to be a lesson for a story to be good.
    
  
        
      I&apos;m glad at least one person agrees with me. I am also not too fond of the Giving Tree despite generally being a Shel Silverstein fan.
    
  
        
      Yeah, it&apos;s just a kids book, man. Not every child&apos;s story has a lesson, or needs one for that matter. Personally, I grew up hating the kid and loving the monsters. So I guess the lesson could be &quot;jerks suck ass and monsters rules&quot;.
    
  
        
      Alyosha, I can get on board with your &quot;jerks suck ass and monsters rule&quot; lesson. But just because something is a kid&apos;s book doesn&apos;t mean it should get a free ride from critique.Benjamin, YES, The Giving Tree, I feel you.
    
  
        
      Gee, why did I waste my time reading this &apos;review&apos;?
    
  
        
      Better question, why did you waste your time leaving a comment?

      Some people.
    
  
        
      Totally agree with the review. I had heard that it was a classic so sought it out to read. Really don&apos;t understand the hype.
    
  
        
      You&apos;re an idiot. lol You missed the entire point of the book. It&apos;s about a young rambunctious boy who imagines a place full of wild creatures like himself, but he realizes that he misses his family. When he comes back, he sees that even though he misbehaved, his parents still loved him and brought him dinner. Stories shouldn&apos;t be full of perfect characters. That&apos;s just boring and unrealistic. Feel free to put your head in the sand.

      And I probably think the title is really How to Kill a Mockingbird too, right? Cos I&apos;m so dumb, get it?! Y&apos;all go play in your own yards now, m&apos;kay?
    
  
        
      What you just said... Actually didn&apos;t make sense. Lol Or at the very least you didn&apos;t understand the other comment about Moby Dick.
    
  
        
      i&apos;m sure glad you provided that insightful analysis of a children&apos;s book. all these years and i could never figure out that this book was a grimdark version of &quot;love you forever.&quot;
    
  
        
      What&apos;s Moby Dick?Bye-bye now.
    
  
        
      Now you&apos;re just playing stupid. :-)
    
  
        
      I know. I&apos;m a real jerk sometimes.

      You do realize that Corey called me an idiot, and you agreed merely because I do not like this kid&apos;s book? Is this the sparkling conversation that these comment threads are encouraging?
    
  
        
      I never said anything about sparking. I will say that I don&apos;t think you&apos;re an idiot. I appreciate your sarcastic sense of humor. Though I completely agree with Corey that you tooooootally missed the point of this book.
    
  
        
      You&apos;re probably not an idiot, but your review of this book was idiotic. :-)
    
  
        
      Seriously, people? This book is not about a child being a jerk. Not even on one page does it showcase Max, the jerk, being disrespectful to his mom. Ummm, maybe you all should take a hike to the nearest grocery and see how kids speak to their parents. Until then, realize that he created his own world to deal with his emotions.... rather than being a &quot;jerk&quot; to his mom.
    
  
        
      ^^^^first year psychology student analysis. listen to it.
    
  
        
      This review is a first rate masterclass on &quot;missing the point entirely&quot;. Fail. It is quite clear that Max feels remorse as he begins to feel lonely. Reconciliation is not explicitly shown in the book, but it doesn&apos;t need to be. Max&apos;s story is one being told the world over every single night. All little boys are mischievous and usually filled with a childish rage after being reprimanded. All mother&apos;s love for their children is unconditional and the thought of their child going hungry is too much to bare. This book isn&apos;t offering morals. It&apos;s an incredibly clever study of how children process anger and aggression through imagination. It&apos;s also about unconditional love. All kids are imperfect, and indeed all kids are &quot;jerks&quot; from time to time. But it&apos;s ultimately the love that his mother has for Max (represented by the warm food) that brings him out of his rage and back from the land of the wild things. As with all childhood tantrums, reconciliation and appologies are inevitable. And an explicit depiction of such would be somewhat pointless.
    
  
        
      Bieng a beast is bad!!!!!
    
  
        
      yeah but in the end the kid meets these creatures who changs his attitude
    
  
        
      dalen you spelled cousin wrong
    
  
        
      I&apos;m in school so I&apos;m a leaper so I&apos;m 2 if it maxes sens but i have relly Strong felings i cud writ a holl appin a bawt it
    
  
        
      I remember the boy was king of the jungle that story is funny
    
  
        
      don&apos;t forget the pro-imperialist message either, as the white man sails across an ocean, discovers a race he perceives to be inferior, and immediately installs himself as their leader against their will
    
  
        
      I don&apos;t respect your opinion. There is a lesson in this story. You have not deep-readed this story yet. Deep-reading is reading written content over and over again. Please read this again.

      Hahaha, awesome. I can&apos;t wait to see the movie!
    
  
        
      I kind of want to see it too, even though I hardly ever go to the theatre.
    
  
        
      I go when I&apos;m not at school, but this may need to be a special case. I think some of my friends with cars would like to go see it, which would be helpful.

  ‘‘and now,’ max cried, ‘let the wild rumpus start!’’
i babysat the other night and, i swear, i read this book at least 30 times within a 4 hour time span (kids, eh?). i never read this story as a child and i cant help but feel like i missed out on something special.but luckily, this is one of those timeless classics that still has something for everyone, no matter the age.this story is for everyone who yearns for wild adventure, for the lovers and attendees of every wild rumpus, for each person who wildly believes in magic, and for those who are wild at heart.this story is for the wild things in all of us.↠ 3.5 stars
         
        
      that very night in Max&apos;s room a forest grew... Love the book. Ran screaming from the movie.
    
  
        
      aww. so happy you enjoyed the book!
    
  
        
      I work often in the Children’s section of my library &amp; love this one for story time :)
    
  
        
      oh, that sounds like so much fun!! :)
    
  
        
      I always loved this one! and the movie was lots of fun too!
    
  
        
      yay! so happy you enjoy this AND the film! its always so difficult for movies to live up to the books!
    
  
        
      Beautifully written review! You really captured the essence of the book.
    
  
        
      This was a favorite childhood book of mine!

           I have read the story of Max about 1,000,000 times and my kids love it too. The illustrations are magical and the text is beyond wonderful. It is one of the most fun and rewarding books for a parent to read to a kid (lots of fun making dancing sounds and monster sounds!) and features joyful plot. A must!
         
        
      Love this, one of the few books from my childhood that I&apos;ve kept.
    
  
        
      One of my all-time favorites. Our copy has entertained three kids, and my youngest is still loving it, ripped cover and all.
    
  
        
      My favourite is the German translation I had read to mme as a child.
    
  
        
      Sweet! I have both French and English for my kids ;)
    
  
        
      Loved the book, hated the movie.
    
  
        
      Oh yeah, that was a catastrophe! Too bad right? I mean Wilder nailed it on Willy Wonka (RIP!!!) but that one was a fucking mess.

      I don&apos;t like it.
    
  
        
      I have read the book - really fun right!? But I haven&apos;t seen the film - and I never will, as it doesn&apos;t sound the best. But this was a childhood favorite... also, can you tell me a bit about your book?
    
  
        
      I absolutely loved both movie and book. The book is a great bed time story and study of illustrations, and the movie is gives so much life to the book.

           I loved this so much, I begged to star in it in an elementary school play. I won the lead role but had to share it with another classmate as we were doing 8 performances and couldn&apos;t be out of classes for rehearsals that often! I got to be rowdy... even though I was the quietest child possible. And who doesn&apos;t love to act like an animal, parade through the jungle and revisit their roots! But what do we love even more... our family and those who love us. Sometimes we can be too much and need to done it down. And that&apos;s the lesson this little one teaches us.

           Please visit our blog www.twogalsandabook.com for this review and others!I can still remember reading this for the first time in my grade school library. The pictures and illustrations can be a little scary at times, but they still remain incredible to me. I love children&apos;s books that are adventurous and take you places. This is one of them.5*****
         
        
      Please take no offence, bu this is on my list of books that are way overrated. The art is amazing, but the plot is non existent. Probably a strange thing to say about a children&apos;s book, but I think the magic comes from the art alone on this one.
    
  
        
      I sort of agree with you on that, but I love the adventure of the book. I almost wish it had more of an ending, but what I took from it was the wild boy after getting into trouble comes back from his adventure with the wild things and he&apos;s maybe a little more in control. Maybe he&apos;s realized now that he was wrong and he puts the wild things to sleep. It reminds me of getting sent to my room as a child and walking back through that door with a change of attitude after some time has passed. I&apos;m weird though, lol. :) Thanks for commenting.
    
  
        
      I really like this one too. I like In the Night Kitchen even better.
    
  
        
      While interpretation is always incredibly important in any writing, and yours is perfectly awesome....I think any mind has to go a long way to get to that point in this particular book. I think it might take a mind that is quite a bit older than the target demographic, for instance. I guess I just wanted more of an adventure on the surface.
    
  
        
      Casey, I totally agree. You definitely have to fill in the gaps yourself with this one. :)
    
  
        
      I can&apos;t believe I never read this! What&apos;s wrong with me?! Lol. :)
    
  
        
      Melissa, that happens to me all the time. :) Have you seen the movie? We liked it. :)

           It is often difficult to review a book that was and still is one of my favorite all-time picture books. I adore everything about Maurice Sendak&apos;s Where the Wild Things Are, from the brilliant text to the expressive accompanying illustrations. And I also with all my heart appreciate the message the author promotes here, a message of unconditional love, a message that even if one misbehaves, there will be supper waiting on the table (Max does get sent to his room, but no matter how much he has misbehaved, his mother will always love him and cherish him). Of course, that particular message is only one of many. As essential as the concept of universal love is the philosophy, is the attitude that children&apos;s emotions and tantrums are to be taken seriously and not ever simply dismissed. Max might be seen and chastised as a &quot;wild thing&quot; by his mother, but his emotions, his actions are described as an integral part of his being, maybe not quite appropriate, but also not completely inappropriate, rather as a living, breathing part of Max&apos;s being. And it is these emotions, these feelings that are the impetus to Max&apos;s adventures in the realm of the Wild Things. However, once Max&apos;s emotions have been allowed and have flourished to the maximum, he retreats from the realm of the Wild Things and is happy to return home to his room, his waiting supper and his mother&apos;s love.I guess I should really mention that one of my more recent rereads of Where the Wild Things Are (in 2011 for the Picture Book Club in the Children&apos;s Literature Group) was the first time I had actually read this book in English. Prior to 2011, I had only ever read it in German translation, and I have to admit that I actually like the translated German version somewhat better than the original English. For those who know me, this is quite a contrary attitude, as I am as a rule very much in favour of original texts and keeping any translated narratives as close to the original as possible. In this particular case, I think that I appreciate the German translation more because it is the narrative that I had repeatedly read to me when I was a child, that I later read for myself (and in 2005 read to my young nieces). The German translation of Where the Wild Things Are therefore has a nostalgic hold on me that the Maurice Sendak&apos;s original text, no matter how ingenious, not matter that it is the master, the primordial, will simply never have (and for me, the ultimate version of this book will always, always be the German translation, Wo Die Wilden Kerle Wohnen.
         
        
      Gundula, How different from each other are the English and German editions?
    
  
        
      Lisa wrote: &quot;Gundula, How different from each other are the English and German editions?&quot;There are not any huge differences, except that in some cases the German version is a bit less verbose. And as I do not have my German version anymore (it&apos;s at my parents&apos; place and the grandchildren have claimed it), I cannot do a detailed comparison. I really want to get a German copy, sigh.
    
  
        
      Gundula, du hast Recht! When I read this book as a child in the early 1970s, I really felt that I was there with Max as he made new friends in this utterly fantastic world.
    
  
        
      Thanks, Gundula.

You know I used to lie in my bed at night (in Germany) and pretend that the room changed and that I was going on my own trip to meet the Wild Things (and I was upset if my parents or one of my siblings opened the door to interrupt my adventure).

      Mine has a few, but not many, and some not in English that I unfortunately can&apos;t read.
    
  
        
      _Where the Wild Things Are_ was a favorite of my children as well. They particularly liked joining in the Wild Rumpus!

      Ha ha! I might try that. I did mention that in some ways she&apos;d love the US: people are SO much more chatty to strangers - something she does a LOT (but which I find embarrassing).

      yes the message in the is unconditional love but the way the character max was acting towards the other character in the book is wrong. You can not treat other wrong and everything is okay. There was not a lesson here.

      I just came across this wonderful review of yours and recognized the book as one my daughter had (English original) when she was a child. I recently found several stacks of boxes with books in our garage. They had been in one of the 2 sea containers we had brought from Germany. These boxes with books had, obviously, never been unpacked. I have started to sort and clean these books, and I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if I found the above book among them. If I do, I&apos;ll make sure I reread this book of which I have no recollection other than the book cover.

      Oh, so much fun to have a box of books you haven&apos;t seen for ages. I hope you find some treasures, Lilo.
    
  
        
      @ Manybooks &amp; Lisa:I WOULD love boxes of books if I had more time to read the books, if the boxes (some) did not have mouse turd in them, if the books (some) had not been peed on by cats (when the protecting tarp had come off), and if I knew where to store all these books. I have 16 full book cases (in 3 properties--home, 2nd home, and guest house), and dozens of boxes with books (at home and at our guest house). And there are more books left in our old, dilapidated (no longer livable) farmhouse in Germany. For the moment, the detection of these additional boxes with books is less of a treasure hunt and more of a nightmare. It&apos;s a good thing I am not President of the United States. Otherwise, this out-of-control book collecting might get me declared insane and impeached.

           I didn&apos;t realize this was The Odyssey for so long. It seems so obvious now! It&apos;s the Cyclops part. Polyphemus.Which makes Max&apos;s mom a stand-in for Penelope, keeping his dinner hot for him as he sails &quot;in and out of weeks and almost over a year,&quot; and that&apos;s a little weird but there&apos;s always something a little weird about Maurice Sendak, isn&apos;t there? Have you read In the Night Kitchen? It&apos;s fuckin&apos; weird, man. None of this knocks Where the Wild Things Are any lower on the list of Great Children&apos;s Literature, where it is #1.It&apos;s everything, right? The way Sendak writes - everything is a little effortlessly different. He starts in media res, &quot;The night Max wore his wolf suit...&quot; I like to evolve the way I say wild things - in the beginning I put the emphasis like &quot;wild Things,&quot; and then I switch it up to the Hendrixian &quot;Wild things&quot; as we build to this: 
  
  “And now,” cried Max, “let the wild rumpus start!”
Which honestly, can you think of a better sentence in all of literature? I&apos;m being serious! I can&apos;t. This is my favorite one.You ever notice how the pictures get bigger? Max making mischief of one kind and another is just a little picture on the page, but by the time the wild rumpus gets going it&apos;s full page spreads, there&apos;s not even room for any words. And those creatures! You&apos;ve probably heard how Sendak modeled them on his family. Look how awesome they are. Which one is your favorite? I like the hippie in the back.And of course it&apos;s great because, like the best children&apos;s books, it takes children seriously. Max is being an asshole. Dude chased the dog with a fork, what the fuck. His mother punishes him and he learns zero lessons, he just plays in his room until she gives in. That&apos;s a plot a kid can dig! Children can tell when a book is written for them and when it&apos;s written at them. This is for children. It has magic in it, and so do they.
         
        
      For some reason, my heart wants the line to be &quot;Let the wild rumpus begin!&quot; Something about the sound of &quot;begin&quot; vs. &quot;start&quot;... I don&apos;t know, man, this is probably why I&apos;m shit at poetry.
    
  
        
      No, I know, me too! Even the book description here on Goodreads thinks it should be &quot;begin&quot; - check it out, someone took it upon themselves to change it. Weird, right? But I actually like Sendak&apos;s way better. It surprises you a little, it&apos;s abrupt and simple. Coming after a $64 word like rumpus, it deflates any grandiose feelings you might have been starting to have.

I see what you mean about the abruptness of &quot;start&quot; - that may also fit better with the ferocity of the rumpus. This is the first time I&apos;ve read the reviews of this book on GR, and there are a number of hilarious 1- and 2-star reviews bewailing its lack of moral compass.

      Don&apos;t worry, I have a toddler who yells things like &quot;I don&apos;t want you, I want a hug from Mommy&quot; at me twice a day, so that keeps my ego pretty well in check.Anyway thank you Olivia, Robin &amp; Julie, you&apos;re very kind and it makes me feel good.
    
  
        
      Yes, Alex, children are the Great Equalizers! Just wait until adolescence. . . My personal favorite is. . . “You’re not actually going to wear that shirt today, are you, Mom??”Well, I’m not now.
    
  
        
      Okay, mind blown and In the Night Kitchen had to be some sort of acid trip.

           There&apos;s a characteristically witty essay by Borges about a man who rewrites Don Quixote, many centuries after Cervantes. He publishes a novel with the same title, containing the same words in the same order. But, as Borges shows you, the different cultural context means it&apos;s a completely new book! What was once trite and commonplace is now daring and new, and vice versa. It just happens to look like Cervantes&apos;s masterpiece.Similarly, imagine the man who was brave or stupid enough to rewrite Dune in the early 21st century. Like many people who grew up in the 60s and 70s, I read the book in my early teens. What an amazing story! Those kick-ass Fremen! All those cool, weird-sounding names and expressions they use! (They even have a useful glossary in the back). The disgusting, corrupt, slimy Harkonnens - don&apos;t you just love to hate them! When former-aristo-turned-desert-guerilla-fighter Paul Muad&apos;Dib rides in on a sandworm at the end to fight the evil Baron and his vicious, cruel nephew, of course you&apos;re cheering for him. Who the hell wouldn&apos;t be?So that was the Dune we know and love, but the man who rewrote it now would get a rather different reception. Oh my God! These Fremen, who obviously speak Arabic, live on a desert planet which supplies the Universe with melange, a commodity essential to the Galactic economy, and in particular to transport. Not a very subtle way to say &quot;oil&quot;! They are tough, uncompromising fighters, who are quite happy to use suicide bombing as a tactic. They&apos;re led by a charismatic former rich kid (OK, we get who you mean), who inspires them to rise up against the corrupt, degenerate... um, does he mean Westerners? Or only the US? And who is Baron Harkonnen intended to be? I&apos;m racking my brains... Dubya doesn&apos;t quite seem to fit, but surely he means someone? Unless, of course, he&apos;s just a generic stereotype who stands for the immoral, sexually obsessed West. This is frightening. What did we do to make Frank al-Herbert hate us so much? You&apos;d have people, not even necessarily right-wingers, appearing on TV to say that the book was dangerous, and should be banned: at the very least, it incites racial hatred, and openly encourages terrorism. But translations would sell brilliantly in Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, and a bad movie version would soon be made in Turkey.I honestly don&apos;t think Herbert meant any of that; but today, it&apos;s almost impossible not to wonder. If anyone reading this review is planning to rewrite The Tale of Benjamin Bunny, you&apos;d better make sure you get your timing right. Who knows how it will be interpreted five years from now?
         
      What a thought-provoking review. I&apos;ve really never thought of the plot of Dune in those recontextualized terms before -- but now that you&apos;ve brought them up, they seem so obvious. I always regarded Dune as a weird sort of acne/drug/new age/anticolonialism epic (in those few instances when I dared to think of it). But I suppose nothing in our hypercoded world is entitled to be &quot;merely&quot; a good story anymore; it must inevitably be weighed down with the ideological and sociological baggage of each successive generation.An outstanding commentary, Manny.
    
  
        
      Agreed.
    
  
        
      Maybe Herbert was prescient? Great review, Manny. You got me thinking.
    
  
        
      Thanks for the kind words! And if anyone is able to sell the concept to an Islamicist movie mogul, I&apos;ll be entirely satisfied with 1% of the gross.
    
  
        
      Indeed, a great review. I just recently finished listening to it on audio CD and couldn&apos;t help but think about the current ME situation.And by the way, perhaps Vladimir Harkonnen = Rush Limbaugh? (Which would leave Bush as Shaddam and Cheney could be the Reverend Mother.)
    
  
        
      I reread Dune about 7 years ago, and was amazed at the same things as you were, Manny. Altho I stopped at trying to figure out who was who. But with the picture of Rush on the cover of Newsweek this week, looking very much like a pig, I&apos;d say Harkonnen is Rush.Ooooh, just saw Terence said the same thing!
    
  
        
      Of course, Harkonnen is Rush. It&apos;s completely obvious, don&apos;t know why that didn&apos;t occur to me. But doesn&apos;t that make Dubya Feyd-Rautha? You don&apos;t see it quite as easily now he&apos;s older, but think about what he was like at the relevant age...
    
  
        
      This was published in 1965. Heart of the civil rights movement and the year U.S. ground troops hit Vietnam. The Cold War was in full swing. From what i have read, Herbert was a progressive...an ecologist apparently. His Fremen were supposed to be Zen communalists who lived in balance with nature--more like native American, perhaps, then Islamicist. The Empire was exactly what you think it is, American-Russian, two faces of the same coin, take your pick. Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire was also an influence. They battle for natural resources. Silent Spring by Rachel Carson was published in 1962.I don&apos;t think he was so much prescient as paying attention.
    
  
        
      Hah, I found your review of Dune. Having read it in the 70s, it hadn&apos;t occurred to me to think of it in the context of the current political milieu. You&apos;re absolutely right, it&apos;s almost creepy how well it fits. Makes the whole thing look very different, doesn&apos;t it? The Borges analogy is so apt, too. Gotta get that into the movie somehow. 
    
  
        
      Great review/interpretation.I&apos;m re-reading &quot;Dune&quot; now for the first time in over 20 years, and I can&apos;t help wondering how much Herbert was inspired by &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; which was released in 1962. I know that &quot;Dune&quot; and &quot;Lawrence&quot; don&apos;t really parallel each other that much, but I can imagine Herbert sitting back and thinking, just as a starting point, &quot;What if &apos;Lawrence of Arabia&apos; was set on a different planet?&quot;
    
  
        
      Excellent review, I think you hit the nail on the head.Having said that, I think it&apos;s also important to note that not all stories have that inherent depth. Sometimes I here people shelve Dune off as the product of mid-century sensationalism (&quot;Get it... they&apos;re fighting... in the desert... with worms!&quot;), but I think the book seeps with so much cultural and ecological commentary that it can&apos;t help but have meaning.
    
  
        
      I read Dune in my early teens. It was a great adventure story and I missed anything else in it! I reread it years later and it seemed to describe corporate politics. I have reread it again am still moved by the adventure, stunned by the scope, and in awe of the man. If you read the rest of the series the intro written by Herbert describes what he was thinking as he wrote.
    
  
        
      I&apos;m astonished that I didn&apos;t know Herbert had lived in Egypt! Where is the intro you refer to? I would like to look at it.Also very interesting to see you linking him with Lawrence Durrell. I have read The Alexandria Quartet twice, and it never for a second occurred to me to compare with Herbert...
    
  
        
      I don&apos;t think this is necessarily relevant - I suspect Herbert was making a wider point than just about the Middle East - but at one stage a Fremen says &apos;we are the people of Misr&apos;. &apos;Misr&apos; (مصر) means &apos;Egypt&apos; in Arabic.
    
  
        
      Hi Choupette. What an interesting detail! Are you learning Arabic then? I&apos;m embarrassed to say I can&apos;t read the script... we have been using it a little at work, but I have been a bit lazy and left all that to our Arabic specialist.
    
  
        
      Yes, I am, but I don&apos;t know enough vocabulary to recognise many of the words, and the difficulties transliterating it into English really do not help. I picked it up straight away, though, because it&apos;s just so distinctive.I&apos;ve actually formed quite a different opinion on the reasons why he uses it, but I think I&apos;ll wait until the end of the book to see if my suspicions are confirmed or not.
    
  
        
      Brilliant observation. I suspect he did have a thematic intention relative to the melange/oil - but the Arabic observations and political are very accurate (and funny).Either way, your thesis is excellent. And I agree. Context - the context the *reader* supplies vis a vis his experiences and social conditioning - is a really important part of a story&apos;s meaning. It&apos;s the implied/inferred argument. A writer may suggest but ultimately it is the reader who settles the matter of meaning.Bravo, anyway - enjoyed the post.
    
  
        
      Thank you, Catherine!I just looked around, and discovered that Brian Herbert has written a massive biography of his father. Almost tempted to buy it. The stuff about using a lie detector on his children sounds seriously creepy.
    
  
        
      Very interesting discussion on the Arabic/Muslim theme in Dune. It remains one of my favourite novels ever since I read it as a teenager. In fact, being a bit of a swot as a schoolboy I remember doing my literary project in Grade 11 on Dune and comparing it to early Islamic history and the concept of the Mahdi (Paul MuaD&apos;dib is clearly the Mahdi). I also recognised the Arabic phrases (I&apos;m Muslim but not Arab) in the text. Interesting observations anyway although I think that its too easy and facile to read it as political analogy/prescience.Other people have read the whole Dune Saga (I never got past half-way through Book 4) as a cautionary tale against destroying the environment...It is, however you understand it, a great sci-fi novel.
    
  
        
      Ah, yes, I seem to recall that he&apos;s even called the Mahdi somewhere. Possibly in Dune Messiah? Though I know nothing about Muslim theology. I don&apos;t suppose you could put your grade 11 essay online? It sounds interesting.I wonder if Herbert said anything about what, if anything, he intended? Though authors are often unreliable on this score.
    
  
        
      I think you just got wiser with age ;) Besides, US&apos;s embroil in the Middle East did not start in 2001, and oil dependency was a hot topic at least since the end of WWII.
    
  
        
      Manny, 1. i&apos;d have to find it first.2. it was written by hand on paper and so i&apos;d need to type it all and i remember it being quite lengthy...perhaps. :)
    
  
        
      Sigh. I suppose I shouldn&apos;t have assumed that everyone already knew the story. My generic apology is here.
    
  
        
      Thanks for point the allegory out. Totally didn&apos;t pick it on the first pass; you just made it so much better in my view.
    
  
        
      Thank you T-dub! I&apos;m not sure when it hit me: definitely not the first time round :)
    
  
        
      Napalm.
    
  
        
      Many of these insights about the novel, as is demonstrated by several comments above, have been made my other readers and critics. (See the Wikipedia article on Dune.) Not Rush=Harkonnen however!Never having seen that article before, and not having read the book in a few decades, most of it is pretty new (and interesting) to me. Thanks everyone.
    
  
        
      And what if Frank did mean all those things? Does it shock and infuriate because... it&apos;s true? It&apos;s no secrete that the Dune series and the contemporaneously written Destination Void series had as their basic theme resource allocation. Perhaps Frank is just pointing at the big white, culturally-tabboo-to-recognise, elephant in the living room of Joe and Jane American in their soft little tract home. Stranger things have happened. We have a set of rules in this day and age that indicates that we are not allowed to espouse the idea that our meddling and trafficking in foreign commodities has repercussions. To even mention such an idea is heinous and unpatriotic. But that doesn&apos;t make the idea false, just offensive to cultural pride.
    
  
        
      Well, I think Herbert could have meant some of it - First World callously exploiting Third, in particular. But if he predicted Osama bin Laden, then I must say I&apos;m seriously impressed. Though maybe Hari Seldon would just shake his head at my lack of understanding of psychohistory and demonstrate Osama&apos;s inevitability with the help of a couple of Rigelian integrals.
    
  
        
      LOL :) Well said. Well said. But I think it bears remembering that our meddling in the Middle East predates by some decades the era we think of as having started with Desert Storm. Manny wrote: &quot;Well, I think Herbert could have meant some of it - First World callously exploiting Third, in particular. But if he predicted Osama bin Laden, then I must say I&apos;m seriously impressed. Though maybe...&quot;
    
  
        
      What a great review! You made me want to read this book, and soon!Thank yuo very much!
    
  
        
      I&apos;ll be curious to see what you think, reading it for the first time at this point in history :)
    
  
        
      Forgive me if you guys have talked about this above. But what did you guys think of all the film and tv adaptations on this? Anyone impressed? Trying to know which one to check out. Thanks.

Trying to know which one to check out. Thanks.&quot;Well, David Lynch&apos;s film is magnificent even if, at first viewing, his depiction of evil is so visceral as to be off-putting. Have viewed it many times and, like any great work of art, it just keeps getting better.
    
  
        
      If we take the indigenous population of &quot;Russia-US&quot;, as it was in 1950, we will see that by 2050, it&apos;ll shrink by 80%. That&apos;s for the &quot;evil empires&quot;. Rush Limbo is another caricature on our civilization. Nothing more. Arab societies are as corrupted by the 20th century&apos;s &quot;progress&quot; as anybody else. There is no place today for people who are tough, smart and have meaningful purpose. Pay attention to what is going on around, my friends.
    
  
        
      Good review!
    
  
        
      Thank you!
    
  
        
      Thanks Manny, this is my absolute favourite review ever ( ps I am missing your daily posts from when you were reading Tragedy And Hope: A History Of Our Time)
    
  
        
      Thank you Fayley! And if I knew of a book which could replace Tragedy and Hope in my life, I would already be reading it...
    
  
        
      Sorry to go off topic briefly, but there is only 1 library in Perth with Tragedy and Hope (University of WA) and the librarian reports an uncharacteristic sudden popularity of the book lately - I wonder if you have other review followers in Western Australia?
    
  
        
      I would like to feel I had that much influence... but, to be honest, I must point out that I got the virus from BirdBrian, and I am sure there are many other carriers...
    
  
        
      Good review. Never looked at it that way before. It&apos;s been about 10 years since I read this. Thinking I might read this again.
    
  
        
      According to Ted in message #28 above, it&apos;s all been done before, but thank you!
    
  
        
      Manny, you&apos;re spot on. I&apos;m reading this gem for the first time currently. As a follower of international politics, an American, and a lover of science fiction I totally concur with your evaluation of this story and its spooky relevance to current events.My friend, you miss the blatant reference to the all-important trigger word in a dialog with our hero: &quot;jihad.&quot; And it was about the time when the first of the Fremen sacrifice himself against a shield-less battleship, &quot;one for three hundred. Seems like a good exchange...&quot; I&apos;m paraphrasing terribly, but you get my point. I&apos;ve been thinking this since they began describing the Fremens. I&apos;ve been pronouncing it like it rhymed with the country Yemen... even more symbolism!
    
  
        
      Ah, the one-for-three-hundred scene! I was indeed thinking of that when I wrote the review!
    
  
        
      Confession: I only read the early comments. I just wanted to say BRAVO! A &quot;like&quot; didn&apos;t seem enough. A book is only partly about what the author writes. By far the largest part of it is what the reader brings to it... and boy, did you bring a lot to Dune.
    
  
        
      Thank you Colleen!
    
  
        
      That is an excellent review of the novel Dune, Manny. And you&apos;re right, so many parallels that can be interpreted as a commentary on politics, the economy and the whole West vs. East.
    
  
        
      Thank you Damian! As you can see if you read the comments higher up, some people are sure Herbert did it on purpose, and others are less convinced. I must look into this more carefully some time...
    
  
        
      What a fantastic review.

           No one should argue the importance Dune. It laid the foundations for a great deal of the themes and constructs in modern science fiction. Frank Herbert was as important to the genre as Isaac Asimov and Arthur Clarke. Unfortunately, just like them, he&apos;s quite dated, and his books can be a labor to read. One thing he maintained from old science fiction was prim and scientific dialogue that no one would ever actually speak. I&apos;ve known many scientists, and they don&apos;t talk like this. You&apos;re not going to convince me a child does.The stuffy dialogue is inserted into even stuffier narrative, until it feels like nothing is organic about Herbert&apos;s prose. This is a terrible tragedy when you&apos;ve got a world that he put so much effort into building - and it is an amazing feat of world-building, technically interplanetary building. But unlike J.R.R. Tolkien, who he is so frequently compared to, Herbert didn&apos;t make sure to include a great story in his world. Instead he included a story that frequently illustrated how clunky an artificial world can be, even if it&apos;s lovingly crafted. I struggled to attach or find interest in anyone, yet they&apos;re more archetypes than human beings, whose logic races past modern skepticism and whose dialogue is cloyingly artificial, the way people cared for the Hobbits, Dwarves and Rangers. In his world-building, Tolkien at least saved himself from being dated by antedating himself, and even with his illuminated prose, wrought more characteristics in just one protagonist than all of Dune&apos;s cast. Even the political intrigue Herbert tries to fall back on was overdone in the Spy genre decades before he started this book. All fans of the &quot;Genre&quot; genres should appreciate Herbert&apos;s massive contributions, but they shouldn&apos;t pretend to enjoy the books if they don&apos;t, and they should be wary of certain pitfalls typical of science fiction that survived into his landmark work.
         
        
      Thank you! I was starting to think I would be ostracized for saying exactly what you have said. The book is nothing but clunky, melodramatic dialogue alternating with clunky, more-melodramatic inner monologues. There&apos;s something very annoying about Herbert trying to convince me that someone&apos;s inner thoughts sound like medieval soap opera dialogue.The book seems to be all talking and acting -- no showing or describing. I agree with your contrasting to Tolkien. I had just come out of reading Jane Eyre. Completely different genre and time, but a similar and painful contrast to Dune: Bronte&apos;s book is full of beautiful, intricate scene and character description and natural dialogue. Going into the stark, unsatisfying prose of Dune was very disappointing. It&apos;s frustrating that such a good idea (ecological warning) got such awkward treatment.
    
  
        
      Also: I found that I couldn&apos;t imagine how anything (technology or scenery) looked. I felt like Herbert sometimes even described things that I&apos;m pretty sure are physically impossible -- but they sounded good to him. Example: riding worms while their segments are &quot;twisting&quot; and &quot;spiraling&quot;? were they constantly running on top of the worm to keep from getting crushed as it spirals along? The description of Paul&apos;s riding the worm was a confused jumble in my struggling imagination.
    
  
        
      I don&apos;t think I noticed the &quot;spiraling&quot; problem when I was reading because by then a certain part of my imagination had glazed over. It&apos;s obviously a ridiculous description, but its composition is symptomatic of so much overwrought Sci Fi and Fantasy fiction. Being in a bunch of workshops, I see the impulse to use flashy words or phrases that felt right yesterday rather than what actually works. Heck, I still catch myself doing it. But it really hurts a book that&apos;s as full of itself as Dune, which Herbert even prefaced as a prediction rather than fiction, when it doesn&apos;t even display a grip on the words it uses. All the the sweeping would-be epics are full of themselves to some degree, but conceit needs to be earned, and severe conceits require more ability than this book had. Compare it against George Martin&apos;s Song of Ice and Fire series, for instance, which can&apos;t go a hundred pages without writing showy narrative or indulging an insipid character - but Martin grounds his characters and controls how the language flows, pacing it so that the pretentious parts are special in contrast to other scenes, and controls the language such that what he wants to be artistically beautiful shines. Martin is a rare writer that&apos;s finally succeeding in non-humorous &quot;genre&quot; writing after decades of stagnant overwriting and pseudo-science babble flooding the market place.
    
  
        
      Brilliant review. Dune is, to me, everything that is wrong with science fiction: meticulous world building, amazing concepts, mind-blowing technology, and a bunch of 1 dimensional generic characters you can&apos;t force yourself to give a crap about. I think most fantasy has basically the same problem.
    
  
        
      I don&apos;t know....I thought Dune is the great book it is because of the things you mentioned. I mean...otherwise...it be some really crappy sci-fi....every SciFi writer have to make his own style. If you are really bothered by the things you mentioned, read his own book, Jesus Incident
    
  
        
      Brilliant review. Thanks for sharing an unpopular opinion. I know I&apos;m going to get pantsed by my friends at the next con I attend for my lambasting of a cult favorite, but I really think this book is over rated. Herbert definitely was a genius at world building, he just should have paid as much attention to his characters. I almost wonder if Herbert wasn&apos;t something of an Autistic savant, Asperger&apos;s syndrome perhaps? To be able to create such a phenomenal world and populate it with such cold, calculating people is almost criminal. I found myself noting that the main characters really only displayed basic emotions, hunger, thirst, fear, relief, anxiety, but they didn&apos;t relate to each other. The death of a child, or a husband, or a close friend is related matter of factly and though the affected party may &apos;cry,&apos; you don&apos;t really know how they feel about it.
    
  
        
      I don&apos;t think there was anything necessarily wrong with Herbert, especially not just because of his SciFi novel. Speculative Fiction history is full of flat characters, or characters who are primarily defined by their roles. There&apos;s even a strong vein in Hard SciFi today that prefers rigor over characterization. I would sooner suspect it was just clunky writing style; I&apos;ve seen similar problems show up in plenty of workshops.
    
  
        
      Strange, I enjoyed it so much I couldn&apos;t put the book down. I didn&apos;t find the book clunky or slowed by useless jargon either. I do agree that each character was more of a single archetype lacking in depth.
    
  
        
      Reading this book again after not having picked it up for some 20 years. I think your comments are completely fair but I&apos;m having trouble thinking of any SciFi author where the quality of the prose or characters is on par with the quality of the ideas. It differs a lot between authors of course but I gave up a long time ago expecting to find them in a SciFi book. Even for authors like Banks. Shame really, I dont know why it is so often this way. Still, an amazing read.
    
  
        
      i couldn&apos;t finish it. i tried really hard, i continued reading it long after i stopped enjoying it.i think the book has great power and the names he used continue to resonate within me in a mysterious way but i really didn&apos;t like the characters.at first i was very negative to the idea of a child messiah, it really bothers me, but after i found out that Paul was 15 years old and not a child i was surprisingly ok with it. but then as the book progressed all the characters became so very annoying, especially Paul, i couldn&apos;t finish it. i latter read the plot and how it evolves and it was very interesting but still i would read the book for that. The only thing that i really wanted to read about is what happens when Halleck tries to kill Jesicca but i couldn&apos;t get that far.
    
  
        
      I agree. Dune is one of those books that is surrounded by the hype of a massive cult following and isn&apos;t actually that great of a read. I found it to be incredibly boring and I&apos;m not a stranger to SciFi. Its been two or three years since I&apos;ve read it but I remember it being a struggle to actually finish reading it. The characters were dull and so was the story. I felt like DUNE was just an incredibly uneventful Tatooine with sand worms that crap resources.Also, the film, while difficult to compare at all, is one of the worst things I&apos;ve ever seen.
    
  
        
      Agreed. My eyes drooped when I read it, and I found it very, very dull. Couldn&apos;t finish it, although I did try! Maybe one day I&apos;ll try again, but I doubt it. The old Dune II video game that my brother and I played on Windows &apos;94 was much more fun than this!

      Lol...
    
  
        
      I think I assumed the characters were cold and stilted because of their upbringing and situation, steeped in duty, tradition, martial virtues, bene gesserit training, etc.. These are people from a different culture - aristocrats, spartans, or whatever comparison you want to make. Not that I&apos;m saying that makes them any more interesting to read about as characters.

But if that was the case, I&apos;d find it frustrating that Herbert presented them as so intellectually/emotionally homogenous, when in most cultures, especially extremely post-modern ones like this religion-seeding culture, there&apos;s usually dramatic diversity, especially across age ranges.
    
  
        
      Well, I couldn&apos;t disagree more. It&apos;s always a complex thing when people say they didn&apos;t care about the characters or weren&apos;t able to imagine them. I mean, I did both. I think it&apos;s funny when Zachariah says it&apos;s surrounded by a massive cult following but not that great of a read -- well, that massive cult following must obviously feel differently. Though, I have thought exactly that about The Lord of the Rings Trilogy. I liked The Lord of the Rings but I feel like Herbert&apos;s story is much cleaner and clearer. I felt like if anything, it was Tolkien who got a little lost in the minutiae of his mythology and the story got drowned beneath it.
    
  
        
      I too couldn&apos;t disagree more. We have a world 10,000 years in the future in which computer technology has been banned and people have been forced to develop mental disciplines that are unimaginable today. You have a child raised by a mother who has no problem spending days at a time working on control of one finger. In that context (yes, context does matter) I have no problem believing that Paul might talk and think as portrayed. On the contrary, I more often have trouble when other writers portray humans of the far future who apparently think and talk exactly like teenagers of the 20th century.

It&apos;s an acceptable interpretation that it comes from the cultural, but if so, the homogeneity across age ranges is entirely unbelievable. Having encountered this argument again, now it feels more like rationalization for something that is actually a style of dialogue and internal psychology that seemed to appear in a lot of SciFi of the time period. That doesn&apos;t mean you&apos;re not allowed to like it, but it was just unbearable to me.

I couldn&apos;t bring myself to finish The Fellowship. I kept nodding off or becoming easily distracted. The films were better but not by much.
    
  
        
      The academic criteria of &apos;serious literature&apos; aren&apos;t always appropriate. Stilted dialogue and archetypal (&apos;stock&apos;, if you prefer) characters are the stuff of myths, fairy tales and the Thousand and One Nights. Ancient travellers&apos; tales were written in a similar style. As for the geopolitics on a galactic scale, it is exactly as childish as geopolitics on a terrestrial scale has never yet failed to be. The lady who thought there wasn&apos;t enough description mustn&apos;t have read with too much attention. It&apos;s decades since I read Dune, but certain scenes –– for example, the conference at which the Atreides meet the Fremen face to face for the first time –– are still vivid in my memory.

However, comparing Dune to classic myths and fairy tales doesn&apos;t do well by me. If you&apos;ve done work in oral traditions and recorded a version of Dune performed like them, I&apos;d be very interested to listen or watch a Youtube video of it. Still - Ovid, Aesop, etc. made archetypes very interesting for two and five pages at a time, and Homer and Virgil gave their characters considerable development and depth at a longer range. There were Greek plays where characters languish that way, but they were written for actors to flesh out on stage. Dune is a doorstop of a novel written centuries of story development after those people, and it uses its space very poorly in contrast to what those texts did with theirs. Between narration and dialogue, it also is much closer to the conventional stilted SciFi of its own time than any bygone styles that I can recall. That&apos;s why I&apos;d be open to an oral tradition adaptation if you&apos;ve done such.
    
  
        
      I&apos;ll make myself clearer. It seems to me you&apos;re applying your personal interpretation of traditional literary critical standards – standards which are themselves entirely arbitrary, by the way, an arbitrary choice made from among all possible ways of appreciating narrative by Western academics in the modern era – as if they were absolute standards.Science fiction (only those who do not like it or understand it call it sci-fi) operates to different standards, as do myth, epic, fairytale, folktale, folk song and many other well-loved narrative forms. Your review of Dune tells us nothing about the novel, apart from the fact that it didn&apos;t fit your particular standards of what constitutes good literature. I suppose that would be good to know if I had to spend the rest of my life on a desert island with you, but happily, that is unlikely to occur. As a matter of fact, Dune doesn&apos;t fit my &apos;standards of good literature&apos; either – but that isn&apos;t the point, is it? It works differently, and in its way it works wonderfully well – as you were obliged to confess, albeit ungrammatically, in your opening sentence.
    
  
        
      Interesting opinion &amp; tastes you have, John Wiswell. I&apos;d feel more comfortable with them if you weren&apos;t trying so hard to pass them off as some sort of objective analysis.Herbert&apos;s work and it&apos;s style is what it is, and it _is_ of a certain period in SF history. So, what&apos;s the big deal? That was then, and this is now. I&apos;m fine with that. I&apos;m one of those odd ducks who re-reads fine works like his (_Dune_ series and others) at least once a decade or so, and comes away just as entertained and inspired as before, and sometimes with a little bit more benefit than the last time. :)I think the first three novels were sheer genius, and they suddenly fell steeply downhill starting with the fourth. The way he wove together many apparently disparate social/political themes -- themes still very much of current concern -- cannot be understated. I think he deserves a bit more scholarly attention, in comparison (not necessarily in equivalence) to Tolkien&apos;s superlative _oeuvre._&quot;All fans of the &quot;Genre&quot; genres should appreciate Herbert&apos;s massive contributions, but they shouldn&apos;t pretend to enjoy the books if they don&apos;t, and they should be wary of certain pitfalls typical of science fiction that survived into his landmark work&quot;&quot;&apos;Pretend&apos; to enjoy&quot;?? Mighty presumptuous of you to second-guess all those other fans like that, Kreskin. How do u do dat?? ;)&quot;Be &apos;wary&apos; of pitfalls&quot;?? Wow, you mean they&apos;re in actual _danger_ if their tastes aren&apos;t the same as yours? ;)These are just my opinions, of course. :)

I merely typed up some of my thoughts. As far as &quot;pitfalls&quot; - yeah, writing like this has caused a great deal of awful stilted SciFi since. That&apos;s a danger to many careers. I&apos;ve watched plenty of writers struggle because of it, and it&apos;s saddening.

      No. I think all kinds of uncomplimentary things about it, but I don&apos;t think it&apos;s nasty. And I don&apos;t believe it should bother you very much what I think. I&apos;m just one person.
    
  
        
      If Dune is over-rated, what kind of a book is not and deserves its praise? I can&apos;t seriously imagine giving this book only two stars. Even taking into account your personal dislike for his dialog, the most you could really hope to downgrade this book to would be three stars. Anything below that I think just belies a personal grudge of some kind, a lack of understanding of what folks value in writing and/or books or a desire to be noticed. I&apos;m not trying to be harsh, but I guess I don&apos;t get your review in the same way that you don&apos;t get this book. Well, I guess that justifies your position!
    
  
        
      I understand your opinion for the most part. I can see where you are coming from, even if I do not agree. However the point about the language the characters use seems completely wrong. This is not our society. If you are brought up with that kind of scientific language used around you then you are going to think in it as well. The reason why your science friends do not talk like this is because society has a basic standard on language. Although you will find that when they talk amongst each other they will use a lot of terminology and &quot;inside jokes&quot; they wouldn&apos;t use around you. The prime example of this are gamers and the ilk. They seem to talk I their own language.

However, using your example, no group actually talks and thinks so homogeneously. I&apos;m a gamer and I don&apos;t rattle on the way the stereotype does, and I consistently run into people who buck the stereotype in every fashion.
    
  
        
      Hmmm... you seem to be getting massive traction on your review. That&apos;s always a good thing. However, I&apos;m going to take a position in stark contrast to your comments.I must admit, I found the book hard to read when I was 10 or so. But I just re-read it (some 35 years later) and was overcome by what I found. In my opinion, it contains beautiful prose, full of mystical dialog and alien-like description. Moreover, if it comes off sounding strange, I think it&apos;s Herbert&apos;s attempt to create futuristic text which helps make it timeless in many respects. So many SF books published in the 60s contain stylistic prose of the 60s, they seem anchored in their founding culture. When the story is far in the future, stylistic prose just sounds silly; one can&apos;t take those books seriously. But Dune? It doesn&apos;t suffer from that, and almost reads like it came through some spice wormhole.I don&apos;t know-- to each his own. But I for one found it one of the most well written books of our time. While other books will be forgotten, Dune will endure. Sorry, that&apos;s how I see it.

      I&apos;ve read Dune three times over the past 35 years and it gets better every time. It&apos;s one of my all time favorites. Maybe it&apos;s a generational thing...
    
  
        
      I&apos;ve read it three times too, and I love it still. Previously a mystery to me was as to how being impressed with a character can lead to fan worship that lasts three decades, but the above made me suddenly realize that perhaps Paul&apos;s control of his fingers had special appeal for me as a young woman.:)Actually, the guy I REALLY wanted to know was the character who the son, worm-boy, kept bringing back to life from the vat. Duncan Idaho must have been a charismatic guy or a looker - he caused the God Emperor Leto to break training for his smile.Putting my strictly literary interests aside, when I read Dune, I had never read anything so complex in science fiction before, and I saw that for the first time what science fiction could be like all grown up. I&apos;m not in love with every plot point, but the politics involved in the books woke me up to politics in general. It also woke me up to the problems I was feeling about organized religion. I didn&apos;t understand before the manipulation and created history that can be built around these two weighty subjects - I was in my early 20&apos;s - it gave me permission to dig into college classes that explored Earth&apos;s real history for the last 3,000 years - and all of that literally freed my caged, religion-chained-up, bourgeois intellect.Between Sherlock Holmes and Dune, I became a grown-up. Dune will always be one of my essential reads.
    
  
        
      It is dated but you cannot judge his work by modern standards any more than you can judge the wort of the Mona Lisa by the standards by modern art. Besides its still better than a lot of the books coming out today.
    
  
        
      wow. it just amazes me what people cannot or do not understand.yet. reminds me of a yogic or perhaps sufi quandry of how to describe a color for someone who has never seen them
    
  
        
      Wow. just Wow. i mean a little bit dated? this book is placed in the future. its hard to be &quot;dated&quot;. we dont know what is to come so its hard to say if its &quot;dated&quot;. and dry drab melodramatic and boring? i beg to differ. this book sparked the beginning of almost all scifi. i doubt very much that you could write a book that sparks the beginning of an entire genre. im sorry that you feel this way but you are completely wrong. i would bet that you never even read the book.
    
  
        
      I did not expect to enjoy this book, but I am halfway through it and cannot put it down.
    
  
        
      It&apos;s short sighted and weird to expect characters 10,000 years in the future to talk in a way that would feel &quot;organic&quot; or natural to us.
    
  
        
      Mason nailed it.
    
  
        
      As much as I hate to agree with the review/reviewer on even the smallest detail, I admit that at first I was turned off by the dialogue... but that lasted all of maybe 3 pages before I came to the same conclusion as Mason and Bukk (and a &quot;cult&quot; of others) and let myself thoroughly enjoy this great work of science FICTION. Is it really so hard to believe that the children of a distant future, who have been conditioned since birth, would speak the same as adults? Especially since you&apos;ve already agreed to accept space colonization and the ecology of Dune by picking up the book in the first place? Not to mention the fact that throughout the story it is repeated again and again that these are not normal children even for the time period. Let&apos;s try not to take ourselves too seriously John.
    
  
        
      Concerning dialogue: how do you know what scientists from Herbert&apos;s era talked like?

A few people on this thread label Dune or the people who love it as a &quot;cult&quot; and it struck me as surprising and strange. A &quot;cult&quot; favorite would seem to be one that didn&apos;t have such a large and mainstream pop culture presence. So I&apos;m curious as to your criteria or perhaps I&apos;m misunderstanding your meaning.
    
  
        
      I can&apos;t speak for Teri, but I do dissent. My exposure to SF fans and authors makes it seem part of the SF canon, at least for America. Perhaps Teri was thinking of how passionate its core fandom is? Not that this would differentiate it from Lord of the Rings.
    
  
        
      I think the dialogue is central to how the plot is revealed to the reader. There are relatively few descriptive passages. It ios through dialogue and monologue (mostly in the form of private thoughts) that the drama unfolds. This is slightly unusual but I absolutely love it. It allows the author to develop characters, tension, atmosphere and but the reader in those edge of your seat situations where they know more than the characters. Some people are complaining that they can&apos;t imagine what is happening in the book. I noticed the sparsity of description but found that I naturally developed my own image anyway. In fact, long descriptive passages that plague some SF books can be a tiresome distraction. As for 1D characters I disagree. Consider the relationship between Jessica and Paul. There&apos;s love there but also fear, anger and maybe a little hate. But there is some depth there.
    
  
        
      I&apos;d like to write my own review, but honestly, I couldn&apos;t add any more than what you&apos;ve said here. I appreciate what it did for the science fiction genre and recognize it as an important step in modern literature, but it has not aged nearly as well as other tales of similar scope.

I loaned it to a young(21) apprentice of mine at work and he is DEVOURING it! He comes in every day and gives us updates.

           Nope. Sorry I don&apos;t get it.I was able to finish it by listening to the audiobook but I was bored throughout the whole 21h.So many descriptions... anyone else found the way Paul&apos;s mom describing him kinda weird?And let&apos;s not even mention how many times I laughed at the main female character being called Jessica.I&apos;m sure I&apos;ll get plenty of comments telling me it&apos;s a classic and it brought so much to the genre... At the end of the day, my rating is always based on my enjoyment.
         
        
      I didn&apos;t get very far in this book at all.
    
  
        
      I find people either hate this book or think of it as their bible.
    
  
        
      I have tried numerous times to read this, and have DNF&apos;d it around the 50 page mark every single time. This may be one instance where I&apos;ll first need to watch the movie before I attempt it again.
    
  
        
      I’ve tried to read it twice had the same problem.
    
  
        
      The cover looks boring as well
    
  
        
      21 hours. Wow.
    
  
        
      One of my favorite sci-fi and fantasy fusions, cast in the light of a future Biblical epoch. The usage of language and narrative feel more like cryptic Old Testament fables... which is what you need to be in the mood for to really vibe on it.
    
  
        
      I got about 100 pages in and couldn&apos;t do it anymore. It&apos;s the first one this year for the challenge that I DNF&apos;ed.
    
  
        
      I pushed through it but didn&apos;t enjoy it either and had rated it 2 stars also. I just couldn&apos;t wait for it to be over! I just don&apos;t get the hype.
    
  
        
      Aw man 21 hours! I skipped this month I knew it wouldn’t be for me.
    
  
        
      Yeah, I won&apos;t ever be reading this. I feel your pain, girl.
    
  
        
      Like @Mellissa I&apos;ve tried to read it twice, because it&apos;s a classic, and DNF&apos;d both times. Couldn&apos;t watch the movie either.
    
  
        
      I read it years ago. While not my favorite I still didn&apos;t think it was bad. An interesting and intriguing universe. I haven&apos;t seen either movie but most of the Dune Fans do not like either one.
    
  
        
      Is it weird that I’m happy that you didn’t like it. I tried it twice and dnf both times. I was afraid you were going to rave about and then I’d have to try reading it yet again.
    
  
        
      DNF’ed at 100 pages. It was too boring to read. Didn’t peak my interest whatsoever. First challenge I wanted to do with you...
    
  
        
      I loved this series. It&apos;s all deep and meaningful. All of Frank Herbert&apos;s ones. I haven&apos;t read the later books by his son and Kevin J Anderson. Each to their Owen I guess.
    
  
        
      I can&apos;t stress this enough. Audio is not the way to go with this one.
    
  
        
      Thats a shame I love Dune, easily in my top 10 books. But I can appreciate that the writing might be quite dry if you can&apos;t immerse yourself into the world.It also has my all time favourite book quote:&quot;I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.”
    
  
        
      Omg I felt the same! So happy I’m not alone in not really getting this book XD
    
  
        
      I alwas rate books based on my own enjoyment as well, so don&apos;t feel bad about that. And your feelings are similar to Merphy Napier&apos;s if I remember correctly.
    
  
        
      It took me the whole month to read, but I really enjoyed it. I have to agree with you on the names though. Everyone has these unusual, exotic names and then you have Jessica and Paul. And I still can&apos;t wrap my mind around the Missionaria Protectiva.
    
  
        
      I am sad you didn&apos;t like because it is one of my all time favourite series. But I appreciate that you tried it. Also, I agree with your opinion about the name.
    
  
        
      Looks like I&apos;m skipping this read
    
  
        
      I&apos;m always interested to see a reviewer pick this one up because it seems like it&apos;s such a polarizing read. Everyone either absolutely loves it or thinks it&apos;s the most boring thing ever. I&apos;m in the former category, but I can see how people on the other side feel that way. It is very dense and a couple of things are only mentioned in passing or are referred to as some long distant historical fact, but become integral to the story, so I get how people might be turned off from that. I also think there&apos;s almost a switch you have to flip when you pick up something like Herbert or Asimov or any of those kind of early sci-fi epics. It is a very different kind of writing and it&apos;s not for everyone, for sure.

      I&apos;m rather surprised I liked this so much, it&apos;s exactly the kind of book I expected to hate. So I totally get where you&apos;re coming from. I agree about the names, Paul and Jessica stand out quite badly. But, as I understood the idea behind the world better, the better I liked it. It&apos;s a future that blends a lot of human languages, cultures and religions. To my great surprise, I immediately wanted to start on book 2.
    
  
        
      I hated this book so much. It is nothing but descriptions and yet I could never picture anything. Like how does an ornithopter actually work? No idea, he never actually told me.
    
  
        
      My sentiments exactly. I was told this was such a sci-fi/ fantasy classic so I tried it but I just ended up bored and annoyed with the book.
    
  
        
      You reading this has gotten me to reread it. Still love it. It&apos;s funny because when I first read it, I thought it was so different from and better than the other classics (even though I enjoyed several of the others). I think it&apos;s the bridge from the Big Three scifi classics writers to the more contemporary writers. But instead of just an interesting concept, Herbet actually does so much more world building. And nope, I never recommend Dune because it&apos;s a &quot;classics.&quot; I recommend it because of how much I enjoyed it. Always interesting to see what bores the hell out of people and what people find fascinating. World building comes in many ways I guess.
    
  
        
      I grew up loving the original film so I already had amazing imagery in my head when I finally read/listened to the book earlier this year- that helped a lot.
    
  
        
      I found the first 100 pages tough, and after seeing visualizations and getting accustomed to the world, I began to enjoy it more - that being said, a book shouldn’t need that to be enjoyable
    
  
        
      I guess I’ll skip this one too! I’m curious about your thoughts on the Ender’s Game series? I am working my way through them now!
    
  
        
      One thing about Dune is that it needs your undivided focus, and people are just not used to that anymore. Listening to it as an audiobook won&apos;t work because you need to most likely reread passages to truly understand the philosophy behind them, the characters intentions, etc. It doesn&apos;t need &quot;visualisations&quot; beforehand, it needs you to pay attention.
    
  
        
      Well it&apos;s not for mm everybody... like most literature. Maybe you&apos;ll like it later in your life. I didn&apos;t get Dune when I was younger, now I love it.
    
  
        
      I enjoyed it even less than you did.
    
  
        
      I have read it many times and I can see what you say. I think with each read I feel that I like it a bit less. It&apos;s still a classic and part of what got me to want to read more science fi.
    
  
        
      Some of y’all are better than me. I dnf this at page 8. I read the first pages and said, “nope not for me.” And I returned it to the library.

The whole 4yo geniuses premise doesn&apos;t work for me... then I heard about the author and just decided to skip his other books!
    
  
        
      I would wait for Denis Villeneuve&apos;s Dune in 2020. The cast is amazing and the director has proven himself to be reliable.
    
  
        
      You are my hero. I really really feel bad everytime I drop something unfinished, so I&apos;m really amazed you managed to finish this book. I also listen to the Audio book but I have to focus so hard, I feel like I am listening to a book for my curriculum. Thx for being honest about your feelings about this book, now I can DNF it without feeling guilty or weak for the first time.
    
  
        
      I loved Dune but I can see how it&apos;s not for everyone! I also had a giggle at the names, especially Paul as the name of the protagonist.
    
  
        
      It is a classic of the genre but I read it 15+ years ago and I too was very bored! At that time I was still in the mind set that I had to finish every book I started I was so happy when I had finished it!
    
  
        
      Took me a second read-through to love it. It was actually an Imaginary World&apos;s episode on Dune that got me excited to try again. Highly recommended listen: https://www.imaginaryworldspodcast.or...
    
  
        
      can&apos;t wait to hear your thoughts on this youtube!
    
  
        
      I was also hella bored while reading this, I don&apos;t know how I made it through the next 2 books in the series but I think this is my limit.
    
  
        
      Had to “read” it for my American Lit class. I read the first 5 pages and then dnf’d it was weird. I just pretended i knew stuff during class and then guessed on every dune question on the exam 😂 it’s supposed to be what inspired Star Wars so I was excited about it...boy was it a let down.
    
  
        
      Just to be clear... you call your profile books with Emily Fox... and all you can muster are five sentences about Dune. Yet, you were compelled (by likes, I suppose) to throw in with all of the robust and detailed reviews of people who either like and understand the series and its universe to say that there were &quot;so many descriptions&quot;, and that you for some reason laughed when you heard the name Jessica. Also... lest we forget... your rating is based on whether you enjoyed the book. Thanks for that new concept and for this compelling take on Dune. I will be following your future reviews with enthusiasm.
    
  
        
      &quot;And let&apos;s not even mention how many times I laughed at the main female character being called Jessica.&quot;I don&apos;t get it.

           In my head, the purpose of this review is very clear. It is to convince YOU to read this book. Yes, you! Waste time no more. Go grab a copy.Machiavellian intrigue, mythology, religion, politics, imperialism, environmentalism, the nature of power. All this set in a mind-boggling, frighteningly original world which Herbert ominously terms as an &quot;effort at prediction&quot;. Dune had me hooked!First impressionThe very first stirring I felt upon opening the yellowed pages of Dune was that of stumbling upon an English translation of an ancient Arabic manuscript of undeniable power and potence which had an epic story to narrate. The tone was umistakably sombre and I realized Herbert was not here to merely entertain me, he was here to make me part of the legend of Muad&apos;Dib. It was intriguing and challenging and heck, since I live for challenges I decided to take this one up too, gladly. The challenge was the complexity and depth of the plot, which left me perplexed, in the beginning. I knew there were dialogues which meant much more than their superficial meaning and was unable to grasp at it. I felt a yawning chasm between Herbert&apos;s vision and my limited understanding of it. However, of course, I plodded on and could feel the gap closing in with every page much to my joy and relief. The Foreword&quot;To the people whose labours go beyond ideas into the realm of &apos;real materials&apos;- to the dry-land ecologists, wherever they may be, in whatever time they work, this effort at prediction is dedicated in humility and admiration.&quot; The foreword makes it pretty clear that Frank Herbert isn&apos;t kidding around. This is a serious effort at predicting how our world is going to look two thousand years from now and by God, it&apos;s a bloody good and detailed prediction. However, the real merit in this effort lies in the commentary on our lives in the present.Why Frank Herbert is a geniusThe setting of the book is arid futuristic. the plot is driven by political mind games reminiscent of The Game of Thrones. The issues he tackles are as modern as the colour television. Herbert&apos;s genius manifests itself in his ability to combine the past, the present and the future in one sweeping elegant move called Dune.Plot and SettingDune is set in a futuristic technologically advanced world which after the Butlerian Jihad (the bloody war between Man and Machines) has eliminated all computers and passed a decree declaring &quot;Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a man&apos;s mind&quot;. Since there are no computers, the essential working of the galaxy is still medieval and feudal with heavy reliance on men and their dallying around. Lots of thriller potential right there. Men with superhuman analytical abilities called Mentats have taken the place of Computers. On the other hand, we have the Bene Gesserit, an ancient school of mental and physical training for female students (it gives them superhuman intuitive powers) who follow a selective breeding program which makes them feared and mistrusted through the Imperium. Their desired end product of this breeding program is the Kwisatz Haderach, a superman who’ll be able to glimpse into the future. How he’ll be able to do this is rooted in Herbert’s idea of determinism: given that one can observe everything and analyze everything, one can effectively glimpse the future in probabilistic terms. Quantum physics anyone? The Kwisatz Haderach is the proposed solution to the male-female dichotomy, between the analytical and intuitive.The plot of Dune is almost wholly set on the desert planet of Arrakis (also referred to as Dune), an arid wasteland where water is so scarce that men have to wear stillsuits which recycle human moisture for further consumption. The source of the galaxy’s interest in the planet is Melange, a spice which bestows upon one longevity and prescient powers. Everything on the planet is permeated with the spice, the air, the sand, the food. Everybody on the planet is hopelessly addicted to the spice, their only hope for survival being their continued intake of the spice. The Spacing Guild, the economic and trading monopolistic arm of the Galaxy badly needs the spice for interstellar transport. This is because their frigates travel faster than the speed of light and hence travel backward in time. The spice is the only way they can look into the future and see their way ahead. How cool is that! All the powers on the Galaxy are out to mine the spice, braving the sandworms, their name merely an euphemism, for they are gigantic 200 metre long creatures which always come digging through the sand whenever spice mining is undertook. Always. There’s also another little glitch. There exist on the planet, the kickass native desert tribal Fremen, whom the foreign powers look down with suspicion and disdain. The Fremen ethos is one of survival and scarcity, driven by tribalism and egalitarianism. Okay, I’ll stop right there. No more spoilers about this. Except that they value water to the extent that spitting on a person is the highest honour they can bestow upon him.Our protagonists are the Atreides family, consisting of the Duke, his Bene Gesserit concubine Jessica and their son Paul, who have been entrusted the stewardship of Arrakis. We discover the alien planet of Arrakis along with them, firstly with fear, suspicion and wonder and ultimately, love and respect. Paul Muad’Dib, however is no ordinary prince. There’s a teeny weeny chance he might be the Kwisatz Haderach, something which troubles him constantly and gives us our conflicted hero. The poor chap trips balls over the spice and has visions of black hordes pillaging and murdering around town bearing his flag and sees his dead body multiple times.My favourite character, however has to be the Baron Vladmir Harkonnen, the most evil character I’ve ever come across in my literary excursions. He is ruddy ruthlessness, he is virile villainy, he is truculent treachery. He executes the inept chess players in his employ which says oodles about his badassery and his fondness for cold-blooded logic. He sees everything in simplistic chess terms. What is my best move? What is my opponent’s best move? Is there anything I can do to completely squash his move? Is there a tactic which leads to mate in three? ThemesIn this setting, Herbert does so much, it’s unbelievable. Religion, politics, the dynamic nature of power, the effects of colonialism, our blatant destruction of our environment are themes which run parallel to the intensely exciting and labyrinthine plot. He shows the paramount importance of myth making and religion for power to sustain over long periods of time. Man, as a political animal is laid completely bare.Real lifeNow these are my thoughts about what Herbert could have meant to be Arrakis- It makes perfect sense. Herbert draws heavy inspiration for the religious ideology of Muad’Dib from Islam. He says “When religion and politics ride in the same cart and that cart is driven by a living Holy man, nothing can stand in the path of such a people.” which is the philosphy of the politics of Islam. Islamism in a nutshell. The spice, much desired by everyone, is the oil. Baron Vladmir Harkonnen is symblomatic of the wily Russians. The Desert foxes Fremen are representative of the native Saudi desert-dwelling Bedouin tribe who have a strongly tribe-oriented culture and undoubtedly value water in equal measure. And the ultimate loser is the environment.Why do good books get over?I almost forget this is a science fiction novel, it’s that real. It is also scary and prophetic. It is a reading experience that will leave you dreaming of the grave emptiness of Arrakis and make you wish you were there to brave it all in the privileged company of the noble Fremen. Frank Herbert achieves the pinnacle of what a sci-fi author aspires to rise to; authentic world building.
         
        
      And you&apos;ll find a lot of philosophical food for thought in this one.
    
  
        
      Joy! How&apos;s the magic?
    
  
        
      You have me at &quot;Machiavellian intrigue&quot; not to mention that I have this on my shelf waiting to be read. Great review!
    
  
        
      Thanks Jonathan! Apart from ample Machiavellian intrigue etched in the plot, Dune is a fantastic feat of the imagination. You should dig it out of your shelf as soon as possible. Hope you enjoy reading it! :)
    
  
        
      I&apos;m sure I will. Dozens have recommended it to me and I bought it at the same time as Way of Kings. No doubt it&apos;ll be good.
    
  
        
      That reminds me, must try some Brandon Sanderson soon.
    
  
      Great review of a great book.
    
  
        
      Thanks Steve! This happens to be one of those books that I believe everyone must read at least once.
    
  
        
      agreed, there: no speculative fiction reader may skip it.
    
  
        
      fantastic review, thankyou. I read thus years ago, and you&apos;ve made me want ti read it again.
    
  
        
      Thanks Cate! I&apos;m glad I made you want to read it again. :)
    
  
        
      Best review I&apos;ve ever read of dune !
    
  
        
      Thanks for the generous praise Mick!
    
  
      Great review Rajat. It&apos;s made me want to pick it up again and read it. Have you read the others in the series?
    
  
        
      Thanks Darren! I&apos;ve read Dune Messiah which I thought was a worthy sequel to Dune. I&apos;m yet to read Children of Dune.
    
  
        
      Wow, quite the detailed review. Nice work, Rajat!
    
  
        
      Don&apos;t miss CHILDREN OF DUNE. My second favorite of the series.
    
  
        
      Superb review!
    
  
        
      Thank you!
    
  
        
      Man this is by far the most detailed and convincing book review I&apos;ve read ! Gonna start this one soon!

So glad my review was able to convince you to read Dune. :)
    
  
        
      A most eloquent, timeless review! I would also like to add that the female characters are also unparalleled. In so many otherwise great sci-fo works they fall flat, but in Dune, they are strong,intelligent,complex, and integral to the entire culture of the Dune world.
    
  
        
      I saw the movie recently and I agree I saw some elements of Islam or that seemed inspired by it. I also got the parallel between melange and oil. Herbert is spot on with the future that could be.
    
  
        
      I have a husband who talks like this. So I am about to read the series for a 4th or 5th time in order to finish up the last few I may have missed. Melange,however never seemed to be analogous to oil. That&apos;s far too simple. The philosophy itself on Dune is intoxicating,as is the spice,the religion, the melange.I had studied Islam in college over 45 years ago and learned that the Hashashin were a group of 11th C Assassins- indeed that is what the word derived from. And they smoked Hashish before going out on a mission. College was broadening.And my teacher was made a Professor Laureate years later. Great teacher.
    
  
        
      This review just convinced me to start this book
    
  
        
      Thanks for the review. I couldn&apos;t agree more. Rarely do books of this magnitude come along. It&apos;s special. I&apos;ll keep my eye out for your other reviews
    
  
        
      It is a great book on many levels..glad you enjoyed it. Great review
    
  
        
      Wonderful review Rajat; loving, thoughtful and inspired. All of us passionate &quot;Dune&quot; fans get it, and hopefully the uninitiated will be persuaded to read it.
    
  
        
      Tremendous review! Thank you!
    
  
        
      I like this review but not as much as I like water
    
  
        
      Excellent review!They have tried to take the life of my son!
    
  
        
      Thanks for the explanation of the Guild&apos;s need for melange. I was perplexed while reading Dune, and had concluded that the Guild navigators were merely addicted to melange. But the fact that melange allows them to see the future because they live in the past, that&apos;s an interesting prospect.
    
  
        
      Hi, that was some review. I don&apos;t know if you are aware of this, but Frank Herbert did say that he took many of his ideas for this book from issues that were taking place in the middle east.

      Amazing review!
    
  
        
      This is such a well written review, I read the book almost 10 years ago and now I&apos;ve decided to continue the series. Somehow I still remember most of the events even after so many years.

      Rajat thank you so much for this fantastic review! You inspired me to read the book and I have recently purchased the entire series. Never have I been so in love with a series and been completely immersed in a story quite like this!

           Dune.No other single syllable means as much to the science fiction genre, a single word that conjures images of sandworms, spice wars, great battles between rival dynastic families and a massively detailed and intricately crafted universe. No wonder this is widely regarded as not just a Science Fiction masterpiece, but a literary achievement as well. Like a study of Shakespeare, the reader finds that this is an archetype upon which many influences and imitators have based their works. The complexity and depth of the creation is staggering and I am continually astounded at the discipline with which Herbert must have focused his imagination.This is the book upon which Herbert would base his greatest series and one that would outlive him as his son has continued to expand and add detail to the vast, immaculate tapestry woven by a true master of the genre. Encapsulating political, economic, sociological, biological, cultural and dynastic themes, Frank Herbert has set a high standard for later practitioners.Brilliant.***2015 reread - Read years later, this has lost none of its narrative power, if anything I can better appreciate the virtuoso attention to detail Herbert exhibited in his epic creation. From the perspective of having read his later 5 Dune sequels, I am astounded at the rich tapestry he has woven. Most impressive was his close omnipresence, analyzing the thoughts and minute actions and subtle nuances of his complicated dynamic interplay of characters. The exhaustive training of the Bene Gesserit and the intricate relations of the Houses and the Guild would stand as a monumental benchmark for speculative fiction ever since.This time around I found myself looking more closely at the Harkonnens and will likely read some of Brian Herbert&apos;s additions to his fathers great work.***2019 reread - I&apos;m even more in love with this book and am again in awe of Herbert&apos;s narrative skill. This time around I noticed that all of the quotes that begin chapters are from Princess Irulan and I paid close attention to how Herbert crafted these interludes.I also was drawn to the religious undertones that really began very early in the book and how Paul realized his gifts and was preparing for his role in the beginning chapters - all demonstrating Herbert&apos;s great narrative skill.Finally, I became more aware of what a great character was Gurney Halleck. While the ghola of Duncan Idaho dominated the later books, Herbert&apos;s creation of Halleck was an enjoyable and thought provoking addition to this masterpiece. 
         
        
      During the 80&apos;s this series had a cult gathering almost rivaling Lord of the Rings. I agree with the review and can only say that those who have not read Dune do not know what they are missing.
    
  
        
      Thanks, Wayne. I have read the original six, by Frank Herbert, and though he never again approached the brilliance of the titular start, the universe he created continued to entertain and impress.
    
  
        
      &quot;political, economic, sociological, biological, cultural and dynastic themes&quot;And a giant worm rodeo...yeeehaaw!Another great review Lyn.
    
  
        
      Thanks!
    
  
        
      Presumably this is a reread? Certainly a highly rereadble book, 3 times for me I think. Love the review Lyn!
    
  
        
      Thanks Apatt. I read Dune pre-GR and my earlier review was too brief and really not very good. I thought that this was one of my favorite books of all time, one of science fiction&apos;s greatest novels, and I owed Herbert a better review.

      From memory, although I need to re-read. I incorporated some of the language from my earlier incomplete and lame review. I had thought about amending and improving the review for some time, then it just came to me.Although a lot of the pre-GR books read are still just ratings for me, too difficult to go back and do it right. Have you had similar experiences?
    
  
        
      Lyn wrote: &quot;From memory, although I need to re-read. I incorporated some of the language from my earlier incomplete and lame review.

There are so many pre-GR books that I want to review but I can&apos;t remember enough details to do it properly. I did cheat on one occasion when I reviewed The Woman in White I read the book years ago and totally love it, last year I saw the BBC&apos;s adaption of it so I based my review on that and looked up some characters&apos; names in Wikipedia.
    
  
        
      Ha! I&apos;ve done similar before and you are right, it is tough to do it from memory without help.
    
  
        
      Yeah, it&apos;s hard to do a decent job reviewing something that has moulded all of my reading experiences since. I&apos;ve read Dune eleven times, if that says anything at all, and I haven&apos;t read it since the mid-nineties.It seems like I should probably revisit the wonderful world again, doesn&apos;t it? Thanks for your review.
    
  
        
      Thanks Brad that&apos;s amazing, I will revisit it too, should we plan a buddy read?
    
  
        
      I sure wouldn&apos;t mind! :)
    
  
        
      I&apos;ve read the entire series three times, although, like Brad not since the mid 1990s I think. I don&apos;t really re-read; to me there&apos;s so much new great stuff I have not read I don&apos;t want to miss it. I&apos;m waiting to find something that could influence me as much as Dune. By the way, don&apos;t even TRY to read the Brian Herbert/Kevin Anderson prequels. Even their attempt at Book 7 is horrendous, although probably worth reading fir completeness.
    
  
        
      Thanks, Mad, and I agree, I very rarely re-read a book, only just a handful and for the most special books.Brad, I have a list of books that authors have asked me to read and review that I need to get to and a few more Silverberg books that I want to read. You want to look at October?
    
  
        
      I agree that Dune would qualify. I think I retread it (by itself, not the rest of the series) in the early 2000s.
    
  
        
      I like to think I don&apos;t reread books, but there&apos;s always a handful that are really special to me. I think October sounds just fine for a Dune read.I think I&apos;ve pinpointed the reason why I stopped rereading Dune in the mid-nineties. That&apos;s when the pre and side-quils started coming out and they started dragging my love through the mud.It&apos;s been long enough since reading the Machine Crusade. I think I can regain my love again. ;)
    
  
        
      Great Review Lyn...I only read the first in the series when I was about thirteen so thirty one years ago but I remember loooooving it.
    
  
        
      Thanks Jaidee. I only plan to re-read the first and I am certain that I will love it all over again.&quot;dragging my love through the mud&quot; that&apos;s an awesome line Brad. Sounds like a plan, an October re-read of Dune, I&apos;m already psyched.
    
  
        
      Me too! :)
    
  
        
      Have begun the 2015 reread. Fear is the mind killer.
    
  
        
      Fear is the Little Death.
    
  
        
      Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.
    
  
        
      I might as well go all in for this Reread
    
  
        
      And the niggling fear that all the sequels will never hold up to the glory that is the first novel, of course. :)
    
  
        
      You, me and Chris - let&apos;s do this!!
    
  
        
      Every time I broke a bone since I was a teenager (through middle-age) I would recite that nice little line to get me through the pain. :) GEEK OUT!

      I think Basia wants in, too. :) We need a Reverend Mother.

      I&apos;d been reading and loving sci-fi for quite a while when I read Dune the first time. WOW - that was different and awesome! Kind of like hearing Led Zeppelin for the first time back in 1969.
    
  
        
      Great comparison
    
  
        
      &quot;No other single syllable means as much to the science fiction genre.&quot;It&apos;s a great opening, but I couldn&apos;t help wondering what the other contenders might be. None sprang to mind, so you&apos;re probably on safe ground.
    
  
        
      Zamyatin&apos;s We springs to mind, but yeah, it&apos;s not nearly as well known. :) Indeed, I can&apos;t even think of ANOTHER single syllable SF work, so the playing field is kinda sparse. :)
    
  
        
      Hmmm, yes We is one, will consider
    
  
        
      Yes yes yes! Reverent Mother. LOVED THAT, Brad! Thank you. Count me IN. I&apos;ll grab it TODAY. DAMN, what a great review. Brilliant point, Dune as an all important syllable in sci fi. : )
    
  
        
      Thanks Basia

It&apos;s not &quot;canon&quot; and it - unfortunately - doesn&apos;t get into the post-Scattering era much (no Honored Maters, alas) but elsewise it&apos;s a wonderful book.And the illustrations of the Baron and Jessica are my defaults when I imagine those two:and
    
  
        
      Agreed, the Encyclopedia was damn delightful. :) I mentioned the effects of oxygen deprivation on the Atreides line elsewhere, and I took it directly from it. Too funny. :)
    
  
        
      I&apos;ll want to check those out, thanks

           I’m sort of tempted to try this again. I don’t think it’ll be worth the hassle though. I could never give Dune five stars because I really struggled to get into the novel in the beginning. It has taken me almost two months to read. This, for me, is a very long time to spend on a book. It took me so long to read because I found the writing style incredibly frustrating. I had to read whole chapters again so I could get the gist of the plot. This was more so in the beginning, which I found particularly hard to read because of the author’s way of shifting between the thoughts of multiple characters. I found this very annoying; however, I persevered over my initial despondency towards the writing, and plodded on through the book. I’m glad I did so because in the end I did come to really enjoy it. Indeed, the story is fantastic, but the writing will always remain unbearable for me.  A truly brilliant plot Dune is to science fiction what The Lord of the Rings is to high fantasy; it is the novel that officially, and unarguably, defines the genre. The story begins with the house of Atreides accepting the Dukedom of the planet Dune. The former Baron has been ousted by the Emperor, and is no longer of consequence. Well, that is how it initially appears. Very early on it revealed that the whole thing is a political ploy to bring the house of Atreides to its knees. The Baron lies in wait, and is ready to strike against the new, and benevolent, approach the Duke uses on the Fremen. The Fremen are the natives of the dessert planet; thus, they know how to survive its harshness above all others. They do this through their frugal approach to water. They value it above all else, and will never waste a drop in earnest. The Baron Harkonnen, as a chide against the natives, squanders water in the cruellest ways. He, and his dinner guests, throw cups of water on the floor of the dinner hall; it was his tradition. The wasted water was soaked up with towels, which the Baron allowed the Fremen to suck the water out of. When the Duke enters he rejects this custom, and is more respectful to the Fremen way of life. He and his son and heir Paul, who is the protagonist of this novel, go as far as to try the Fremen’s grossly effective water saving suits. These Stillsuits, quite literally, recycle all the water the body wastes and feeds it back to its wearer. The Fremen way is the right wayThis early familiarity, with the Fremen technology, no doubt helps to keep Paul’s mind open when he is later forced to live amongst the Fremen. Paul is somewhat of a marvel; he is prophecy’s chosen one. When he eventually gains the trust of the Fremen they allow him to choose a Fermen name. He calls himself after their most revered prophet: Muad&apos;Dib. They accept this and follow him as their leader. His inherited title of Duke dictates that he is their lord, but their religion determines their real loyalty. He has to, quite literally, fight for every ounce of their trust. Indeed, it does not come cheap, and will only be given to one who is a member of their people. “Without change something sleeps inside us, and seldom awakens. The sleeper must awaken.”Thus, Paul becomes their saviour. Consequently, he receives heaps of character development through this book. He goes form boy to the revered leader of a nation. The Fremen, like Paul, want the evil Baron Harkonnen gone from their planet. They do no want a cruel oppressor who is ignorant to their ways: they want Paul. I think the imagination behind the Fremen culture really is wonderful. They have efficiently adapted to survive their harsh planet. To emphasise this point you need only look at the fact that off-world humans live in fear of the giant Sandworms that infect the planet whereas the Fremen ride them as a coming of age ritual. Indeed, Paul has to ride a worm if the Fremen are to follow him. Deep characters The result of this is a very complex, and intriguing plot. I found the first third of this book to be very perplexing initially. This is a world we are told about rather than shown at the start. We hear about the Fremen but do not truly understand them till the very end. I was very overwhelmed at the beginning, and in all honesty I do think this novel merits a re-read to further establish my understanding of it. This did affect my rating because it inhibited by enjoyment of the book. “Deep in the human unconscious is a pervasive need for a logical universe that makes sense. But the real universe is always one step beyond logic.”Indeed, aside from Paul there is a whole host of dynamic, and well rounded, characters. His mother is to be the new revered mother of the Fremen people, which for someone of her age is quite remarkable. There is also the captain of Duke Leto’s household guard who is a very deep and honourable individual. As much as I came to like these characters I was still frustrated with the writing of them in the beginning. I found it difficult to read scenes in which up to four characters internal thoughts are portrayed alongside their dialogue. It wasn’t always clear who was thinking. I much prefer a narrative that is focalised through one person. Well, at least one person per chapter.  Overall, I thought the idea behind this novel was utterly fantastic. However, my personal reaction to the writing style limited my overall enjoyment of the book. I do intend to read some of the sequels. However, I do not have any intention of doing so in the near future. Maybe, in a couple of years I will return to the brilliant, and annoyingly written, world of Dune.Postscript: I thought |I’d show of some more pictures of my beautiful folio society edition of Dune. Also, all of the pictures (except the first) in my review are from the artwork in this edition. Enjoy!    
         
        
      A very expensive version as well. But bloody beautiful nonetheless. ;)
    
  
        
      I agree, but I do feel like it&apos;s worth it. It is a really good quality book.
    
  
        
      I was curious so had to do a search for this, wow, 75 English pounds one site wanted...kind of puts my 8.99 (still unread) paperback to shame haha

      I saw this edition online and I am hypnotised by it! I haven&apos;t read the book but I like science fiction. Should I give in and buy it?
    
  
        
      I&apos;ve just started reading it, and so far I am loving it. It was bought for me before I’d even read it because “it sounded like my sort of thing.” I think considering that is the science fiction equivalent of what The lord of the Rings is to fantasy its very unlikely that a reader will hate it. So I think it’s worth the risk. The edition is superb. I find myself being really careful with it, when I’m reading, because it feels so special. I love it.
    
  
        
      Thank you very much for the response. I think I am going to do it. It seems extremely precious and I believe I will like the story too.
    
  
        
      I hope you do too. I&apos;m not too far into it yet, but I&apos;m enjoying it greatly.

      I got the same edition myself; yes, it really is lovely. And this probably means I need to reread all of the Frank Herbert Dune books (he wrote six; there are only six Dune books; the end) sooner rather than later.
    
  
        
      gorgeous! And yes, I agree with Joseph. There are no Dune books past Chapterhouse

      The parts of the book that were good must have been amazing for you to give 4 stars. 2 months is an insanely long time to read a book, even a fairly large one(around 600 pages or so, I believe). That&apos;s like 10 pages a day. I don&apos;t think I&apos;d be able to stick with a book that failed to keep my attention to that extent.This is the most interesting review I&apos;ve ever read haha.

      I have the Barnes &amp; Noble Collectible Edition of Dune and I love it, but the pictures from yours are amazing. I completely understand why you can&apos;t give it 5 stars. I mean I got the book and was planning on reading it, but then one of the English classes in my high school decided we would read it, so I decided to wait and read it with the class. It&apos;s a good thing I did because the teacher I had really helped us understand everything before we even got into reading it, which is why I was able to read it without any problems.
    
  
        
      It took me two attempts to read the first Dune novel (practically a year apart) and now I have all the books up to Chapterhouse. I think it&apos;s a series you do have to soldier on through at the start XD

I want to have fun when I read, not grit my teeth as I push through, I think I&apos;ll leave this series here for now.
    
  
        
      why the f*** do you give away the whole f****** plot in a review?
    
  
        
      Thank you, Im having the same problem of getting into dune. Its good to know that its worth the effort.
    
  
        
      This is exactly how I feel, and I’m only on page 96!!! Oh god, do I go on?

           Update: $1.99 on kindle US today 8-6-17I was so worried that I wouldn&apos;t understand a thing in this book. I will admit there are some things that went over my head but for the most part I figured it out. I remember a billion and 65 years ago I watched the movie and was like what the? Basically all I remember is Sting and sandworms. I would love to watch it again and see if I understand it more after reading the book. I&apos;m still not sure what all the spices were about on Arrakis. I keep thinking it&apos;s like their farming like we would farm corn or tobacco, etc. I could be wrong and I didn&apos;t get the connection between the spice and the sandworms. Is it like a drug to them? I did read in the back of the book that is was like a drug when taken in small quantities and really addictive when taken in large quantities and that Muad&apos;Did felt his prophesies were because of the spice. I liked Duke Leto and I hated that he was betrayed not long after they got to Arrakis. There is always some twat out there causing trouble. I really enjoyed Paul&apos;s character and his mother Jessica. They seemed like really strong people and adapted very well in everything they were put through. I didn&apos;t really pay too much attention to the other characters or I guess I should say I didn&apos;t have many thoughts about them. With the exception of the ones that betrayed them. I really enjoyed when Paul and Jessica had to travel to get away from the evil Baron Harkonnen before they were killed too. I don&apos;t know why, but I enjoyed their little journey. I think they were both great in their roles when they were found by the Freman and showed they were a force to be reckoned with. Now maybe I&apos;m getting this all wrong but I&apos;m trying to tell it through the way I saw it in my mind. I don&apos;t understand how Paul&apos;s sister, Alia, was an abomination. That one must have went over my head too. It might have had something to do with the poison Jessica took to become the Reverend Mother. I&apos;m not sure but I know some of my goodreads friends that read this will get me sorted out =)Other than the sandworms and traitorous people on Arrakis, I was most freaked out by the thought of the water issue! I would NOT was to live somewhere there was a water shortage. And the part where they were talking about selling foot water, I can&apos;t even. Which basically means your stinky foot sweat! Overall I really liked the book. I enjoyed traipsing through this desert with Paul and his mother. Only in book form though, not in real life! Since they are doing re-makes of about a million different movies, I wish they would re-make this one because I think it would be really awesome! I would like to see this land come to life in today&apos;s time! I don&apos;t know if I&apos;m going to continue with the series as I have heard this is the best one and the others get confusing. But I would like to see how Paul is as a ruler and what all happens to them, or maybe not depending on what all happens. If anyone can answer any of the things I was confused with that would be helpful =)Also, I have seen some pictures on here of this really cool Dune book with art in it. Does anyone have a link of where to get that book or is it still available? Thank you :-)MY BLOG: Melissa Martin&apos;s Reading List
         
      Hope you enjoy.I liked Dune and Dune Messiah. I struggled with Children of Dune and then quit reading somewhere in Heretics of Dune. The sequels became progressively weirder and less interesting.Mr. Herbert&apos;s son and Kevin Anderson wrote several pre-quels and a couple of sequels that are a lot more accessible.Dune is a biennial read for me.
    
  
        
      I keep hearing that from different people. I love what I have read so far! I haven&apos;t updated because unfortunately I have hit a reading slump. :-(
    
  
      Aaaaargh!The slump.That hit me while reading Marissa Meyer&apos;s &quot;Winter&quot; last week. Too loooong...I also have my head in too many different books right now.I&apos;m committed to reading a chapter in Harry Potter every day with my younger son, but other than that, I think I&apos;m going to do like you mentioned...Curl up with &quot;Morning Star&quot; and read.Part of the problem for me is Goodreads. I&apos;m always trying to think of something clever to say in the forthcoming review (that nobody reads), and spend too much time trying to figure out how I feel about the book instead of simply enjoying it. I am not meant to be a critic or an artist...just someone who enjoys art.&quot;Dune&quot; is amazing.
    
  
        
      Everything you just said!!! Omg!! I&apos;m just tired of reading and reviewing and trying to figure out what to say. And I&apos;m reading on a few really good books right now but I&apos;m stuck and want nothing to do with it. I&apos;m trying to watch some British shows on Amazon Prime and movies and stuff on Netflix. I&apos;m missing my books but I&apos;m just stressed about it all and I want the fun to come back :-( I&apos;m glad your reading Harry with your son though :-)
    
  
      Sometimes, we have to change the medium of our entertainment/information. I no longer have the attention span for TV shows and movies. YouTube!!!I think that after I finish my 2016 Challenge (I&apos;m a bit retentive about finishing something that I start), Goodreads and I may go on an extended hiatus. I had a different way of tracking my books, but my wife said I should do Goodreads.I have read a couple of books that I absolutely loved and would have never read if not for recommendations from Goodreads friends.I have to read Harry Potter. I&apos;ve never read it before. This was as good an excuse as any. My son and I enjoy the time together, and we need that. We have a hard time connecting.
    
  
        
      I love all of the books I have found from friends through goodreads! I love good reads and my shows. I&apos;m just stuck in the slump. I&apos;m glad you and your son can connect through Harry! That&apos;s really great :-)
    
  
      That&apos;s a more positive way to put it. I have enjoyed every book recommended to me on Goodreads, but that&apos;s only been a couple.I think I&apos;m at my year point on Goodreads, but I didn&apos;t do anything social on the site until April. That was very limited.I&apos;m trying to be more &quot;outgoing&quot; by barging uninvited on to threads about books/series I like (&quot;Empire of Storms&quot;...ahem...sorry about the barging), but that&apos;s not my comfort zone. I think I only saw your &quot;Empire of Storms&quot; status because Trish liked it.Hope you find your way out of the slump (If not, I may get to &quot;Empire&quot; before you), and that the shows are as good as you anticipate.
    
  
        
      Thanks, Dave. I really want to get to my Empire of Storms because it&apos;s one of my favorite series but I have only read two chapters. And a few chapters on other books. Sighhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! I hope I can read a little when I lay down but I don&apos;t want to push and stress myself. Goodreads is very enjoyable if your social so get on into it when you feel more comfortable :-). And I don&apos;t mind talking to anyone that&apos;s nice and barges into my conversations. Lol
    
  
        
      Omg!!! I just saw your from Knoxville!!! I was born in Lake City and all of my family but parents live in LaFollette, Jacksboro and Knoxville!!! Freaking small world :-D
    
  
      I&apos;m not really &quot;from&quot; Knoxville, but I&apos;ve lived here for 15 years. I&apos;m from out West.After dragging my wife all over the United States, She wanted to live in the South (she&apos;s from Mississippi), so Tennessee it was. There were reasons for Knoxville that I won&apos;t post publicly, but may or may not have something to do with me wanting to worship the Sunsphere. :)I love Knoxville other than a couple of weeks in April and October when allergies are insufferable.So you&apos;re a fan of Lake Norris?It is a small world. (We don&apos;t need to sing that song, do we? Ugh!)Thank you for the friend quest. Someday, I&apos;ll make my momma proud, and be the social belle of the ball.
    
  
        
      Before I became home bound me and my dog and folks would stay in cabins at Norris Lake. But we mostly did hints here in Chattanooga. Hiking up at Ocoee in the Cherokee Forest, hiking The Chickamauga Battlefield in GA which is only 20 mins from the house and hiking and picnicking at Red Clay State Park. We spent more time up in LaFollette staying with my grandparents on the farm. Anyhoo, I think I&apos;m going to spend a quiet day off here today. I&apos;m trying to keep up with all replies but I still need a break for a bit. :-/
    
  
      I&apos;m a sorta social media camel...I can go days without replies. Like probably most everybody, I enjoy engaging with someone and sharing opinions and experiences, but I&apos;m not hurt if it doesn&apos;t happen. I understand the difference in demands on time when one has a thousand friends, and one has a dozen friends. I&apos;m not sure how you keep up.The Ocoee area is beautiful, but I&apos;ve never hiked it. We raft the Ocoee every year, and every few years, we canoe on the Hiawassee when TVA is spilling or generating. (Have you ever been at the dam when they&apos;ve started up the turbines?)Two years ago, we biked all over Chickamauga. We tried to go in order of the skirmishes at the creeks, and then the main battles along the road and the retreat up the hill. Hard to imagine that a violent, bloody battle took place there.We spend most of our time hiking in the Smokies. 100-year anniversary this year for the NPS, and they have an award for hiking 100-miles in the park. We&apos;re going to fall about 70 miles short. :) I have a couple of (what I think are) cool photos of a hike in the Black Mountains.Sorry that you&apos;re home bound , and have lost (hopefully,only for a time) doing something you clearly loved.Enjoy your day way. &quot;Dune&quot;, if you want something &quot;heavy&quot;; &quot;Empire&quot;, I imagine, is a bit &quot;lighter&quot; and faster moving
    
  
        
      Yeah, mom and dad still go to Gatlinburg. They are there now. I don&apos;t care for hiking there as they don&apos;t want you taking your dog and all the places I mentioned are down from my house. I have seen the water come down when they open the damn for the rafting. I have canoed with my canoe in the Ocoee River where all of the boats put it. I have camped up there. But the Battlefield is where me and my dog and dad hiked most weekdays. Always on the horse riding trails so we could meet the horse plus they were hills and we loved the hills. Did a little bit of biking but not much because I liked being with my dog hiking more than anything. We hiked at Norris as well. They have some awesome hills that will just about kill you but me dad and my dog soldiered on Anyway, those days are over. You have a great day my friend. I&apos;m hoping I can read later :-/
    
  
      I&apos;m not a fan of Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge. I had a really bad experience on the Strip a few years ago. We always go into the Smokies via Townsend. We did stay in the Roosevelt Lodge a couple of years ago with some friends which was nice. (Their money not ours which made it even nicer.) I had to come back early to work which also made me the caretaker of our dogs for the remainder of the weekend.The first time I saw the dam release water was amazing. Horns and yellow siren lights. Next thing you know, there&apos;s a four foot wall of water coming at you. River level went from about 8&quot; to 5&apos; just like that.Your dog did ok around the horses? That&apos;s a cool way to spend time with your dog...and your dad.I&apos;m sorry those days are over. If the story is not too private, I would love to understand. Still sounds very painful for you...No complaints on my day. Breakfast with the boys at McD&apos;s and then shopping for fun. Didn&apos;t buy much. Normally, I would waste a fall Saturday watching college football, but no games worth warching until UT-VT tonight.
    
  
        
      Melissa, great review! I&apos;m so glad you enjoyed this book. I have a copy of it on my bookshelf but have been avoiding it lol. Wasn&apos;t sure if it was my kind of book or if I would understand much of it. I feel more encouraged to give it a try after reading about your experience! Now it will just be a matter of when to read it :)
    
  
      I would continue with the next two books, Melissa. They still center on the same characters as &quot;Dune.&quot; Herbert does some very interesting (and terrible) things to/with the characters. If &quot;Dune&quot; is &quot;Happily Ecer After,&quot; then the sequels not so much.If you liked Leto I and Jessica, then I would highly recommend the prequels. The &quot;Butlerian Jihad&quot; explains the setting...why they have Mentats instead of high speed computers, etc. That trilogy also has a very strong female protagonist. She makes Jessica look a bit whiny. &quot;Butlerian Jihad&quot; does not revolve around the generation prior to Paul. But for more Leto and Jessica and Bene Gesserit plotting, &quot;House Atreides.&quot; All of the prequels are very accessible.(view spoiler)[Here&apos;s my attempt to answer your questions. Been a year or so, and I&apos;m going from memory not Wikipedia.Sandtrout were introduced to Arrakis. The creature hoarded all the water and turned Arrakis into a desert. Their poop becomes melange, and if the trout live long enough, they become sandworms.No one wanted to terraform Dune because it would kill the sandtrout and eliminate the source of spice. Even Muad&apos;dib was going to keep some desert areas for the spice and to preserve the Fremen&apos;s way of life.If the sandworms don&apos;t reach full-size and are drowned by the Fremen (sandworms and water don&apos;t get along), then the Water of Life (not melange) is produced.Jessica rook the Water of Life while she was pregnant with Alia, and either the Water or Jessica using her Bene Gesserit training to control her body&apos;s chemistry in neutralizing the poison (remember they can control the sex of the embryo), caused Alia&apos;s embryonic brain to reach full consciousness and have access to all the collective memories before her. She was born being able to speak and with all of the training of a Bene Gesserit. (hide spoiler)]Wasn&apos;t Sting awesome as Feyd Rautha? His hair was the best effect in the movie....And Captain Picard as Gurney Halleck...Did you read the book in one day?
    
  
        
      Maybe you should give the TV series a go: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0142032/Just saying;-)

      You read &quot;Dune&quot; (minus 100 pages) in two days?!Wow! That&apos;s at least a two week read for me. I know reading is not a competition in the Olympics, but that is a big deal. Impressive.
    
  
        
      Awesome!

      I read this so long ago, and I remember that if you didn&apos;t read the book first then the movie was a big WTF. If you liked Dune, then I tin you&apos;ll like the two sequels better. They answer your questions if you pay attenton.Somehow, I think the author foresaw the first Oil Crisis...
    
  
        
      I hate it when I can&apos;t edit a typo... Damn autocorrect fixes things that aren&apos;t misspelled!
    
  
        
      I know, John, I feel your pain. I can&apos;t stand when I find typos every time I turn around and the damn phone types things I have never even heard of! I might read the other books then. Actually I think I might have the second book. Hmmm, I will check when I feel like going through all of my books again. Uggg.
    
  
      The second and third books are also much shorter.The remaining books in the series get progressively &quot;weirder&quot; (because the Navigators, Gom Jabbar, Mentats, heart plugs and sandworms aren&apos;t really weird :) ) and more difficult to read.After the first three, if you liked the Duneverse, I would highly recommend the Butlerian Jihad trilogy.And Melissa, for me, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s a schedule issue as much as an attention issue. I can&apos;t read Herbert for extended time frames. I have to take breaks. That&apos;s what impressed me about you reading it in a short time frame.
    
  
        
      Great review, Melissa! :)
    
  
        
      Thank you, Candace :-)
    
  
        
      Great review Melissa.I read these books so long ago I can barely remember them but they were my introduction to fantasy which I have loved ever since. I remember being fascinated by the Bene Gesserit and all the details about the Dune world.
    
  
        
      Thank you, Phrynne :-) I think I&apos;m only going to read the next two books in the series because so many people have told me it gets confusing after that.

      I tried to read this one and never finished it because it was so complicated for me. I&apos;ll have to give it another shot.

      Nice review, Melissa.Dune is one of my all-time favorites. You&apos;re right in saying that it&apos;s complex, but I like that in science fiction, thought not as a steady diet. And I see that Dave seems to have answered all your questions, so I won&apos;t add my 2 cents to the mix, except to suggest you read the other two books in the original trilogy.
    
  
        
      Thank you, Charles :-) You can add anything you would like. I still don&apos;t understand why the little sister was considered an abomination. Do you know? I&apos;m going to read the next two books because a lot of people told me they were good but not to go beyond that.

           Update 8/28/17Re-read. Number 13. :) I cry when Paul meets Gurney. I shiver when Jessica consoles Chani. I&apos;m awestruck by the peaks and troughs of time, free-will, and the weakness in Paul even as he heroically strives against the evil that is about to be unleashed upon the universe. *sigh*Perfection. Easily the number one book I&apos;ve ever read. :)I waver, sometimes, but right now, it is my absolute favorite. :)Original Review:This is a phenomenal classic of literature.It&apos;s not just science fiction. It transcends science fiction, as a fascinating discussion of free-will versus inevitability. Can the Jihad be denied? Can Paul ever really avoid his own death, despite seeing every time-line play out with him as the butt of every cosmic joke? Can even cruelty or mercy even remain comprehensible after such knowledge?Yes, I think this work outdoes Nietzsche. It certainly does a great job of making us care about the question.Is this all? Is this just a work that pays great justice to philosophy of action and inaction? Or is the novel merely a clever play at turning the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle into the physical embodiment of a man? It is that, of course. The Kwisatz Haderach can be many places at once, and he can be both alive and dead at the same time just like that certain cat.Is the novel a coming of age tale, first set as a mirror against his father Leto, only then to mirror the whole universe that had just turned against him? Yes, of course. He was, after all, both the product of all his upbringing and his genes, embodying the question of nature versus nurture. He was taught within many schools of martial arts and assassins, as well as training the mind in both the schools of the Mentats with their pure logic and that of the mystics, the Bene Gesserit, that allows complete control over the body down to the cellular level. And if this training wasn&apos;t enough, he was deeply schooled in politics, leadership, and the meaning of loyalty. The boy was raised right. Of course, that is nothing without ninety generations of genetic bloodline tampering from the Bene Gesserit, right? To become the fulcrum between cellular memory, tapping the minds and lives of all your genetic ancestors as well as tapping the ability to fold time and space, to become the eye of a storm of time.What a damn brilliant setup for one tiny character, no? His training links to the unlocking of his genes and to the life-extending and enveloping spice, Melange, to make him not merely aware of time in a theoretical sense, but eventually to be unable to discern what was in the past, the present, or the future. Here&apos;s a true Super-Man, well beyond Nietzsche.And don&apos;t believe for one second that this serious discussion about what would make a superior man makes for dull reading. No. We&apos;ve got PLOT that&apos;s probably some of the most exciting and visceral in all of literature, driving us right into the web of intrigue, vengeance, treachery, and galactic politics. To quote the text, we&apos;ve got &quot;Plans within Plans,&quot; and it hardly stops there. We know the House Atreides is falling into a trap laid by the Emperor and House Harkonnen, and yet free-will and pride prevents any chance to avoid it. The setup is brilliant and extremely political, giving us character sketches of some of the most brilliant and memorable characters of all time.Duke Leto, the Red Duke, the most honorable and beloved leader.Duncan Idaho, the emotional and intuitive hero.Gurney Halleck, archetypal loyalist and troubadour.Lady Jessica, the woman who ought to have had all honor in life, but was unjustly reviled and set aside for political necessity. (Chani being both her mirror and her eventual glory.)And of course, my favorite character of all time, Paul Muad&apos;dib Atreides, the one that would prevent the greater evils he foresaw, and went to enormous lengths and sacrifice to achieve, but who eventually failed in his task because even a god cannot overcome destiny. (Or the will of so many minds set as one.)So damn brilliant.Frank Herbert spent five years writing this treasure, working and reworking it until he published it at age 25. None of his other works come close to this masterpiece, and there&apos;s little wonder. It was birthed, fully-formed, like Athena from Zeus&apos;s head, with enormous forethought and care. The worldbuilding was just as carefully formed, from the ecology of Arrakis and the life-cycles of the sandworms, to the history and the creation of the Fremen from their mild beginnings as Zensunni Wanderers, adherents to the Orange Catholic Bible, to their history of oppression so like those of those who are Jewish, to their settling and hardening of their bodies and souls in the wastes of Arrakis, also just like the Jewish who carved out a place for themselves in Israel. (Current politics aside, this was a very potent idea before 1965 when Herbert wrote this, and indeed, the core is still just as powerful when you turn it back to Muslims.)The Galactic culture is rich and detailed. The CHOAM economic consortium, with their monopoly on space travel and their need for the Spice to allow them to see a short period into the future to plot a safe course before folding space. The Empire is caught on a knife&apos;s edge between a single power and every other House who sit in the possibility of putting aside all their squabbles for the sole purpose of checking the Emperor, if they so desired. (And Duke Atreides was such a possible popular leader among all the Great Houses, which was the primary reason the Emperor wanted him dead.) And of course, we have our Villains. The Baron Harkonnen has always been a crowd pleaser. Brilliant in his own right, devious and able to corrupt anyone with just the right sorts of pressure, including a certain absolutely trustworthy doctor we might mention.&quot;The Tooth! The Tooth!&quot; -- You can&apos;t handle the Tooth!Feyd Rautha Harkonnen is especially interesting for the question of nature versus nurture.The Bene Gesserit had intended him to mate with Paul, who should have been Leto and Jessica&apos;s daughter, and that offspring should have been the cumulation of ninety years of a breeding experiment to recreate the Kwisatz Haderach which had come about almost by accident during the Butlerian Jihad in the deep past, to overthrow the AI overlords.He was practically Paul&apos;s genetic twin, or at least, his potential to be the &quot;One who can be many places at once&quot; was on par with Paul. But instead of fulfilling the kind of destiny that we get with Paul, we see him grow up under the auspices of his Uncle the Baron, becoming as cruel and devious as he was deadly. He was the argument of nurture in the conversation, of course, and having so very little of it eventually cost him his life.I often wonder about the directions that Dune could have taken, all those little paths in time and circumstance that could have been. What if Feyd had been brought to Arrakis earlier and overwhelmed with Spice the way that Paul had? Sure, he wouldn&apos;t have been able to convert the unconscious changes into conscious manipulation, but he might have had enough glimpses of the future, the way that the Fremen did, to have given him the edge he would have needed to kill Paul.And then there&apos;s a relatively minor character, Hasimir Fenring, the Emperor&apos;s personal assassin, who was nearly the Kwisatz Haderach, himself. Unable to breed true, he was still potent enough to be completely hidden to Paul&apos;s time-sight in the same way that Paul was hidden from the Spacing Guild&apos;s weaker time-sight. His training as a skilled killer was also superior to Paul. He was, by all the hints and tricks in the tale, Paul&apos;s perfect downfall. It always gives me shivers to think about, and it was only in a single instant of both recognition and pity from Paul that stayed Fenring from killing our hero. It was just a moment of whim.The setup was gorgeous. Paul&apos;s pity, had it been missing at his moment of greatest triumph over the Emperor, would have meant Paul&apos;s assured death. I still wonder, to this day, what stayed Frank Herbert&apos;s hand from killing his most wonderful darling. We knew the pressure of religion and politics was going to have its way upon all the oppressed peoples of Dune. The return of a monstrous religious Jihad was going to happen one way or another, sweeping across the galaxy and toppling the Empire, regardless of Paul&apos;s frantic plans and desires. Paul&apos;s own death would only mean a higher level of fanaticism, and Frank Herbert&apos;s warning against unreasoning devotion would have been made even clearer with Paul&apos;s death.Perhaps it was pity that stayed his hand. Who are we to say who lives and who dies?If you really think this review is overlong, then I apologize, but please understand that I could absolutely go on and on much longer than this. It is a symptom of my devotion to this most brilliant of all tales.And yes, it still holds up very, very well after twelve reads. I am quite shocked and amazed.
         
        
      I&apos;ve seen the trilog when I was a teenager and was fascinated by the universe created. But I only found out this was a book (and a good one) a couple of months ago. I hope to be able to read it soon!
    
  
        
      A very good argument can be made that this is the pinnacle of all SF. It&apos;s absolutely not Everything that SF can do, but it has probably the most impact on all of fandom.For example: I never read anything before I was 13. Dyslexia. Taught myself how to get around it. I started learning to love books through Horror. It was the bomb. Nothing would ever supplant my Love.Then I watched some crappy movie on Fox in two parts and it was pretty epic for being so craptastic. I thought to myself, &quot;Hey, if I was going to try reading something outside of my terror zone, I might try this. I kinda like the power vacuum set up here and how this kid got himself set up so sweet. He has real power, too. How did he do that with his voice?&quot;So I cracked the book. My first SF.I was never the same. It was upon reading this book that I decided that reading was probably one of the best things ever. It not only cemented my fate with books, but it also made me a convert to SF by way of a REALLY HARD SELL.It was like I had built this impervious mountain of gore around me and then someone came along with the grandmother of all sandworms to scatter me and my preferences to the bone-etching wind.*sigh*Can you believe I even got an English Degree because of this bad boy? It&apos;s not even considered a classic by any snobby mainstreamer or even a part of cannon in any classroom I&apos;ve ever heard of, and yet I always placed it there. It&apos;s just genius. :)Am I a fanboy? Um. Yes, and probably embarrassingly so. :)
    
  
        
      *lol*Thanks for this detailed insight and a heartfelt congratulations for overcoming dyslexia!It&apos;s always fantastic when someone has such a bond with a book (or with several)!I actually heard a lot of people say that this book was the mother of all SF so although it might not be on any reading list at any university, it seems to have made quite a name for itself. :)Since I unfortunately come from a family of non-readers, I never had any bookish background, no legacy so to speak, nobody to give me recommendations or tell me about old goodies. Which is why I&apos;m such a fan of GR and all you guys! Thanks to my best friend, I at least got to see good movies and some of those led me to great books. It sparked my curiosity. This friend also introduced me to classic children literature (he&apos;s half American so his family had read those books to him when he was little) and I&apos;m still reading up on those.So I&apos;ll definitely read this one (and think of young Brad). xD
    
  
        
      lol *grin*My dad never reads anything but engineering manuals and my mom doesn&apos;t travel outside of romanceland, so I do understand. I know it&apos;s not quite the same thing, but absolutely none of my tastes were informed there! GR is a great late addition to my education, but it is still late.God, what I wouldn&apos;t have given for it back in the late eighties.
    
  
        
      And I in the nineties!Back then I had to rely on what I saw when we were in certain stores or what I got for my birthday (or school, later). Nevertheless, I got curious about certain subjects and at least my grandfather sponsored me. But I missed out on sooooo many things! If I think about all the great books I could already know ... *sigh*I also feel the pang of envy whenever people post about their experiences when growing up in a bookish household or having wonderful libraries.We can&apos;t change the past so we just have to make sure we miss as little as possible now. ;)
    
  
        
      Very true. And it&apos;s never too late to read great books NOW. :) I&apos;m still discovering that I may never plumb the depths of great literature. :)
    
  
        
      *lol*I try to dip my toe into every literary water. Sometimes I get sucked in and dive in a particular genre for quite a while before resurfacing and going somewhere else. Sometimes I dip my toe and hate it so I move on very quickly.*sigh*So many books, so little time! xD
    
  
        
      twelve reads? Damn you must love this- nice review :)
    
  
        
      Oh yes, I do indeed love this book. Ever since I was 14, I read it once a year until the eleventh, then I discovered that I could practically quote every single passage in the damn novel, so just reviewed it in my head until last year when I challenged myself to see if my memory was still correct. And it was. :) But who could be surprised at that point? lolAnd thanks! :)
    
  
        
      wow...twelve reads, impressive. That&apos;s almost as many times as I&apos;ve read The Catcher in the Rye. I know they have nothing to do with each other, but Salinger, just like Herbert in your case, kept calling out to me as I grew up and everytime I read the book I found different things I could relate to and nuances I had missed. I think I could also quote it if I wanted to. That said, awesome review and I have to admit that, having studied philosophy, Dune might very well be up my alley so I will give it a try. I can assure that my review will not do it justice, but I&apos;ll try :)

And you overcame it on your own? Wow, just when I thought you couldn&apos;t impress me anymore...see, you *really* are Super Brad!!!! :)) No wonder the book resonates so much with you. Well done, man!
    
  
        
      Heh don&apos;t worry, my review didn&apos;t, either. Btw, loved The Catcher in the Rye, too, but I think I loved Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters &amp; Seymour: An Introduction slightly more. That was one hell of a family. ;)
    
  
        
      Came really close to quitting school, too. I always wonder about others. In the end, thought it&apos;s all crap. The anger, the depression, the confusion. It&apos;s not like any of us go through anything different, right? Dyslexia or no, we all need to find our balance, our bliss. :)
    
  
        
      If only I could write a review as good as yours hon :-)
    
  
        
      Love this review, I need to reread as well
    
  
        
      So good. :)
    
  
        
      Brad, I&apos;ve been wondering, is Dune actually a standalone or not? I&apos;ve heard from my friends it&apos;s an amazing sci-fi but the rest of the series sucks, which made me kinda reluctant to read.. :/
    
  
        
      The first is quite good as a standalone and can be treated as such without any loss.However, the second and third books follow soon after the events of the first even if they aren&apos;t quite the sublime quality of the first book. They *ARE* good SF. All six are really quite good, in fact, but when you compare them to this penultimate masterpiece, they fail.If they were written by someone else and had no need to live up to such a standard, they&apos;d be hailed as pretty fantastic works. The world-building is great, the ideas threaded throughout them are fantastic, and the characters are gorgeous and go through so many changes. Literally.But they don&apos;t shine with the same brilliance as the first, and so people say they suck. Even I said that, once upon a time, and it took decades before I tried them again, trying to read them with a clear eye.I&apos;m glad I did. I really enjoyed them. :) They&apos;re dense with great ideas and some really shocking awesomeness if you&apos;re patient. :)

I&apos;ll get to the first book and see what I think about it first! :)
    
  
        
      Great review, Brad!
    
  
        
      Talking about being a fanboy, I bought the illustrated edition by folio society. Had to sell a kidney, but the illustrations are astounding. The definitive edition, IMHO.

      &lt;3
    
  
        
      I have never read this book before (or seen the movie) and I see there is a remake coming out starring Jason Momoa and Javier Bardem.My question is...if I read it now will it still hold up? I see you have read it 13 times so my guess is EFF YES but wanted to hear your thoughts.
    
  
        
      LOL, yeah, well, the novel is just as good today as it was back in the day. It has staying power. :) Ecology, jihad, prescience, epic family vendetta, and amazing worldbuilding. :)I have no idea if the new movie will be good but the director has come out with some great films already so I have very high hopes.
    
  
        
      Ok awesome! I was pretty positive that would be your answer...but wanted to hear your thoughts beforehand. I love that it still holds up! Thanks! 👍🏻
    
  
        
      I kinda wanted to re-read it AGAIN this year but I think I&apos;ll postpone it till right before the movie comes out. SO EXCITED.
    
  
        
      Same, I&apos;m planning my re-read to be just before the movie debut...Can&apos;t wait!
    
  
        
      :) :)
    
  
        
      Bradley wrote: &quot;I kinda wanted to re-read it AGAIN this year but I think I&apos;ll postpone it till right before the movie comes out. SO EXCITED.&quot;And me, I think I&apos;ve read it around 8 times over the (last 40 years) years and it is probably in my top 5 novels of all time (with LotR). I agree with you that the rest are still good but as you say, just not as truly stupendous as the original.I remember my mother asking me why Sting was running around in silver underpants, and I also remember the fact that Patrick Stewart had no idea who Sting was on set, and thought he played &quot;Double Bass&quot; in a &quot;police marching band&quot; *lol
    
  
        
      Quick question tho: if it&apos;s one of your top 5 novels of all time, why do you only give it a 4 star? lolIf anything, this one should always hit the 5 star category. :)

           I blame the movie.I was an avid but novice fantasy and sci-fi reader in 1984 when David Lynch’s Dune rolled out as a big-budget adaptation of the 1965 classic book. It was an artistic and box-office failure with Roger Ebert calling it “a real mess, an incomprehensible, ugly, unstructured, pointless excursion.” Numerous references were made to its excessive length, particularly a tv edition that was over 3 hours long. I never did pick up the classic sci-fi book, assuming the commentary heard about the movie applied to the book. All that changed when I broke my finger and found myself with a lot of extra time on my hands (groan).Besides, sandworms. Dune has a lot of ingredients that don’t fit into my preferred stories, yet the gestalt was not only tolerable, but engrossing. It begins with the Atreides family preparing to shift their holding from their current home to the planet of Arrakis. The Emperor has given the Atreides the territory and trade on the planet of Arrakis, formerly under control of their enemies, the Harkonnen. The planet Arrakis is hot, arid and generally hostile to life. There is, however, a small population of native, fierce Freman who have managed to build an existence in the desert. Paul Atreides is the young heir of the family, and mystical testing reveals he might be the one prophesied. Paul undergroes a rapid growth curve, facilitated by his teacher Dr. Yeuh and his father’s advisors. But it is in the desert that Paul will discover his strength as well as his new people. Seriously, now.Honestly, I have to wonder how much of this like is generational. If Sanderson or Rothfuss wrote this book, two chapters in Dune would have made a whole book, and while detail may have been added, it likely would have made for a book as slow as the movie. I liked the scope of Dune, and that there is a resolution to the initial conflict. It is also interesting that despite the volume of concepts packed in here, with political maneuvers, terraforming, technology, cultural assimilation, and mysticism all playing roles that I didn’t find it overwhelming, perhaps because so much is genre-familiar. On the downside, it could have perhaps used a bit more transitions, particularly near the end when months at a time are skipped. Writing was solid; nothing really stood out, but it told the story well. There’s some vague mysticism that might irritate those who like explanations. It was a bit of an eye-roller to have the chief villain be a fat, gay, sadistic pedophile, but Herbert really isn’t thinking outside the trope character box much (it’s not enough that he sentences people to death but he has to be physically abhorrent? And gay?). World-building is fun, but standard desert.Overall, I’m glad that I finally took the time to read it and put those old assumptions to rest. I love a good hero.  
         
        
      I&apos;m glad!
    
  
        
      i&apos;m working on the review... hope it amuses and explains.
    
  
        
      Nice review. Love the Bacon. :) Did you fry it up with a little Melange?
    
  
        
      Great review! I read this so long ago, I need to re-read it.

      Umm..the correct rating would be 5 stars ;)This was one of those seminal books for me. I read this when I was in my late teens and it has always held a special place in my reading experience. I still read it every few years. Glad to hear you enjoyed it.
    
  
        
      I can see why it would be a personal favorite, Ctgt. It holds up well for 50 years old!
    
  
        
      I love this book and I love your review! I actually reread Dune this year. It&apos;s weird. Some books I read for the first time, get an idea about what&apos;s about to happen, and then don&apos;t enjoy the reading because I&apos;m just waiting for whatever it is to happen. With Dune, I&apos;ve read it and seen the movies and I know how it all goes down, but when I reread it I&apos;m still hanging on every word looking for a way that things can go differently. Glad you liked it!
    
  
        
      thanks, Naomi. i imagine the political background and the spice issue gices it a lot of layered re-readabilty. Plus, classic hero tale.
    
  
        
      If you&apos;re still at all struggling to get past Lynch&apos;s destruction of this book, I can recommend the documentary &quot;Jodorowsky&apos;s Dune&quot; - utterly bizarre but a fantastic watch! (I&apos;m unsure what Jodorowsky&apos;s film would have been like (or if it would even be watchable) had it come to pass but the documentary of his creation process is fascinating!)
    
  
        
      I would have loved to see Jodorowsky&apos;s creation, too. What a mindtrip that documentary was.
    
  
        
      Hero tales are the best. But I&apos;ve learned something about myself recently. I only like self confident heroes. Paul, for instance, knows exactly who he is because he can see into the future and the past. Spider-Man, on the other hand, is a whiney little b**** who should&apos;ve let somebody else get bit. Oh geez. I may have brought old grievances where they don&apos;t belong.
    
  
        
      LMAO on pictures!! :D
    
  
        
      Guess I&apos;ll be giving Lynch&apos;s adaptation a skip, then, since I&apos;ve just last week discovered Netflix has it. You&apos;ve also given me the weird idea of rereading this book with the Tremors movies and Weapon of Choice song playing in the background. Fun review!
    
  
        
      Love the Tremors stuff. I should probably re-read this at some point.
    
  
        
      Everything&apos;s better with a side of Bacon lol. Nice review, Carol. I&apos;m glad it worked out for you.
    
  
        
      Glad you liked it - I revisited it on audiobook for the first time in 25 years and it was still amazing. Also watched the Lynch movie and (as my review explains), I don&apos;t think he quite deserves the scorn that is usually heaped on him. He certainly couldn&apos;t capture the book, but who could back in 1984. It was a valid artistic attempt, even if it failed. I REALLY want to see Jodorowsky&apos;s Dune, that looks fascinating. Just wish I could rent instead of buy. And I did order the mini-series done by Sy-Fy Channel, which is waiting under the Christmas Tree - haven&apos;t heard much about that.I strongly recommend avoiding all the Dune sequels - all the complexity, with none of the excitement. Hugely disappointing.
    
  
        
      I need to reread this book. What a shame Jodorowsky never got his Dune made. Moebius storyboards and concept art! the documentary of Jodorowksy&apos;s Dune is really great.
    
  
        
      The mini series wasn&apos;t horrible. It had some strengths that the Lynch movie didn&apos;t, but it also had some unnecessarily added parts. Book 2 and 3 are combined in the second one, which I&apos;m ambivalent about.It&apos;s kind of odd, on reflection... I&apos;ve watched the extended Lynch over twenty times. For a real piece of shit, it&apos;s still popular, and not just with me. I know quite a few people who still watch it every now and again.I make fun of it, sure, but it WAS the whole reason I read the book in the first place, to my everlasting joy. :)
    
  
        
      Your reviews never disappoint Carol, lots of insightful observations there. So,  Dune Messiah next? :)
    
  
        
      LOVE the text/image mash up! Dune is a huge ideas book, even when particular ideas take a bonkers turn, somehow it all works together. I really should reread it. (The rest of the series doesn&apos;t achieve the same magic; I don&apos;t remember much of book 2 but book 3 was so silly I couldn&apos;t read any more after that.)
    
  
        
      I hated book 2, but I liked how book 3 became book 4. The action wasn&apos;t great, but the ideas were. Leto II was the shit, and I loved what he became in books 5 and 6, but Duncan Idaho REALLY stole the show. I remember geeking out HEAVY after reading the first book right after finishing the series.The first book was really fantastic, but taking the entire series together as one majestic flow of &quot;The Golden Path&quot; was truly fantastic in conception, if not particularly enthralling in execution. Still, I don&apos;t think they were that bad. They suffer mostly because we compare them to his masterpiece, but in terms of regular SF, they&apos;re still damn good. I loved what the Bene Gesserit pulled off in creating their Duncan Idaho, and dealing with the remnant of Leto II just blew my mind.Great ideas.
    
  
        
      Nice review. First book is the best. If you do read any sequels or prequels, stay clear of the ones written by Herbert&apos;s son and Anderson.
    
  
        
      --- Unless you are a glutton for punishment, and I was, but I quit after the Butlerian Jihad trilogy. It just feels like milking the sacred cow, and I had such high hopes.

I don&apos;t want to say any more than that here as I don&apos;t want to spoil anyone who does want to read it.
    
  
        
      Well it&apos;s true that Ghanima&apos;s story arc wasn&apos;t that impressive, but I did enjoy (or hated to see, actually,) Alia&apos;s progression, and of course, Paul.

Never too much Bacon, Mimi!Thanks for the advice to all you movie/tv/adaptation watchers out there, but i&apos;m not much of a tv watcher. The Lynch adaptation sounds creepy too--overplayed sexuality. But the cast list has Sting and Patrick Stewart. Too funny!I&apos;m not sure I&apos;ll be going on--the consensus even among dedicated Duners is follow-ups not so good, no?
    
  
        
      I&apos;d say leave it as a standalone; better that way. (I definitely don&apos;t qualify as a dedicated Duner though; it&apos;s just the first book that really lives in my mind.)
    
  
        
      The ones written by Frank were very satisfying... AFTER the fact. ON reflection. ;)
    
  
        
      Awesome review Carol! I was actually just telling my kids about Tremors the other day:)
    
  
        
      I just ordered the collectors&apos; edition... of Tremors.

      The rebirth of the &apos;creature-feature.&apos; Thanks, Athena.
    
  
        
      Excellent review, as always. I&apos;ll just add my $.02 and recommend against the sequels. Dune on its own is a classic. I could never get into the other books in the same way.
    
  
        
      Thanks, Mr. Matt. I&apos;ll take the suggestion. You steered me right on Dune--I think it was your re-read that caught my eye.
    
  
        
      It&apos;s Kevin Bacon! No way! Just read the book, never new it existed! And boy do people take sci-first seriously! But these are the first pics of the movie I&apos;ve seen! Thanks!
    
  
        
      Kevin Bacon is awesome. Really, first pics? It&apos;s a cult classic from the 80s--totally cheesy. But it didn&apos;t stop me from ordering it!
    
  
        
      I love Tremors, such a great, fun movie! Works spectacularly well with your review... :-)
    
  
        
      Thanks, Cathy. Tremors is fun! I made my mom watch it as well. :)
    
  
        
      This book is pretty huge (at least by my standards), so I haven&apos;t picked it up yet in case it was quite dry or more cerebral or slow. But I&apos;ve heard so many good things about this, and your review has made me put it up a teensy bit higher on my priority list. :)
    
  
        
      I thought it moved pretty fast, Gauri. It is certainly a classic, but there are other books that are--gasp--better if one has limited reading time :)
    
  
        
      Sweet review! THAT&apos;S what I&apos;m talking about!(But the movie DID have Sting.)
    
  
        
      Oooh, good point, Mike. I forgot about that.
    
  
        
      I read this one while in university, so it&apos;s a little hazy in my memory. I remember I enjoyed it, and reread this a couple of times. I never moved on to the following Dune books, though.
    
  
        
      Brilliant connection to Tremors! I just saw they made a Tremors 5 in 2015 ten years after the last one. Reboot!

           Ok, my only reference for Dune was the 1984 movie with Kyle MacLachlan. And, honestly, it was the main reason I&apos;ve always wanted to read this book.Ohmygod look what that fake-looking piece of plastic shit is doing to poor MacLachlan&apos;s nose? How was he even able to act with that thing pushing his nostrils to the side of his face? I can&apos;t stop looking at it!Anyway.I remember loving that movie when I was young. Ahhhh. I honestly didn&apos;t remember much about it other than it was sorta weird, there were giant worms, a bunch of people had glowing blue eyes, and Sting was in it.After listening to this audiobook, I decided to rewatch the movie and relive the good times. Wow. Just wow. What in the holy hell did I just watch? Because whatever it was, it certainly didn&apos;t have much to do with the actual book. There were some fucking weird changes that they made to the movie that really didn&apos;t do anything for the plot. Like that gross dude with the shit in his face that flew around in that goofy air suit?In the book, he&apos;s just a fat dude!And that thing they do where they all have drain plugs attached to their hearts?Not in the book, either!In fact, none of that fucknut crazy/gross sci-fi shit is in the book.Blowing shit up with their voice guns? Nope.Bald Bene Gesserits? Nope.Bugs with butthole mouths? Nope.Mentat&apos;s with clip-on eyebrows who drink juice that gives them herpes lips? Nope.Captain Jean-Luc Picard going into battle with a pug? Fuck no!The list goes on and on...Not that it should matter. But it does! Because I was expecting something realllyreallyreally different, and if you go into this (like me) you may end up...well, not disappointed but maybe shocked? Having said that, I think the book was definitely better. There was no reason for ass-mouth monsters or oily rock stars in weird rubber underwear. It just makes a lot more sense the way Herbert wrote it. It&apos;s a magic is science tale set in space with an incredibly interesting look at how politics and religion can hold hands with each other and make war babies. I can see why people rave about it. It&apos;s honestly an incredibly insightful novel.You know, if you&apos;re into that sort of thing... A little dense, but worth it. But dense. That&apos;s worth saying twice because this thing is massive and you may get lost in it if giant word monsters aren&apos;t your jam when it comes to reading. I listened to the Audible version which is 21 HOURS (and 2 minutes!) long and might be the way to go for anyone looking for the easy way out.And I am ALWAYS looking for the easy way out.
         
        
      Dune.. my Moby Dick.. I have started reading it several times, and I really enjoy what I&apos;ve read, but I always drown in its density.
    
  
        
      Yep. That&apos;s why I&apos;ve been listening to the audiobook while I do other stuff. There&apos;s no way I&apos;d ever make it through this sucker otherwise.
    
  
        
      Oh yes, the one with a complete voice cast, right? I bought that too, haven&apos;t given it a go yet.
    
  
        
      Yep! I got it about a year ago and am just now getting to it, as well. It&apos;s pretty good. I&apos;ve been listening about twice a week and I&apos;m still nowhere near done, but it&apos;s interesting. Way better than Dracula - my last audible.
    
  
        
      Ahh this film... so bouffant. And sting in those gold underpants.... an image I&apos;ll struggle to keep out of my head as I go in for the re-read
    
  
        
      I remember my parents renting the film, and saying it&apos;d be okay for me to watch - I was 7 years old.The Harkonnen blood plug made a big, terrifying impression on me.
    
  
        
      I remember loving the movie, but for the life of me, I can&apos;t remember much other than it was sort of dirty. Like...with dirt.
    
  
        
      I&apos;ve just googled the underpants. Turns out they weren&apos;t actually golden. 😂😂😂
    
  
        
      Have read the book . Didn&apos;t even know there was a movie . Did knee that Hollywood was about to make a movie for 2020
    
  
        
      Yeah, a David Lynch movie, even. And yes, that also was a weird choice a the time.
    
  
        
      I only hope the movie moves a little quicker than the book. Boy was that thing long winded. The best sleepin pill I ever took.
    
  
        
      My favourite book, think I&apos;ve read it 6 times now. Still love the movie, has hardly anything to do with the novel but they hired David Lynch, what did they expect? Guy is a certified weirdo

      Lol. In fact, ROFL! Very entertaining review. I definitely did not remember the pug. Many things in the movie were very weird. The voice guns always really bugged me. I read the book first, btw. I always wondered what people seeing the movie without having read the book make of it. Because it makes no bloody sense.

      Funny thing, H.R Giger was originally intended to be on the art direction team on the Dune movie when it was still in Alejandro Jodorowsky&apos;s hands. You can check out some of his artwork, its surreal as all hell.

      If you&apos;re interested, regarding Jodorowski&apos;s Giger-Dune (cool bandname), there is a documentary about that project, called Jodorowski&apos;s Dune, I think. Haven&apos;t watched it myself yet.

The Mentats were just dudes with computer-like brains
    
  
        
      I’ve read up to God Emperor of Dune. It’s definitely weird and I am not sure the writing stands up but the central conceit of the idea of religion, war, control and free will is fascinating. I’ve been meaning to go back and reread God Emperor as the books get super weird and my younger tiny brain couldn’t take it. Perhaps now that I am older (and grumpy) I can handle it.
    
  
        
      And maybe I’ll go back and re-reread Dune - there is a fancy collectors edition that I’ve been coveting 🤗
    
  
        
      It looked like it got weirder and more &apos;out there&apos; as the books went on. I would love to read about his kids but I&apos;m thinking I&apos;ll just watch the movie?
    
  
        
      Books 2 and 3 are good. Book 4 is very boring although I read it all. Some people say that they get better on books 5 and 6.
    
  
        
      Anne, best review of Dune ever! Eva! (In a Boston accent). I am impressed you held on for 21 hours. This is one of my favorite books. But I stopped reading the sequels as they were so bad. Thank you for the laughs!!!!
    
  
        
      This. Review. Rocks!!!Well done Anne! 🤣😂👍
    
  
        
      great review! I want to read this book. But I am afraid it will be just like you said, and easy to get bogged down in.

           Once upon a time,I called a friend of mine,Asked him hesitatinglyI want to read him a poem,If with him, it&apos;s fine!He tells me why not, Go on, go on!I&apos;ll listen to you until myEnergy is gone!Exuberent I was, As I beganBut with excitement came The fright!What if I start stuttering?What if I don&apos;t do it right?What if I don&apos;t do my best?What if I shake, the whole day and night!!But once he put allhis attention on me.I recited the poem,As a human and not a zombie. He listened to me first,With full concentration and trust,His laughter prevented me to slump,And my nervousness started to rust!On and on I went, And stopped not until it was done.He says I made him emotional,He hasn&apos;t listened such recital,No! from none.Oh! The jump I jumped!When the smile he smiled!Oh!The paradise then I got!When the laugh he laughed!No other day in The history of history, had been like thisWhen he tells me &apos;I see A panoramic future with you, Miss!&apos;Oh such perennial felicity! As felicity can be!Oh! The places I went!Oh! The places I&apos;ll go with him and see!!Next day he calls and tells meHe can&apos;t wait anymore!I ask him if he&apos;s okay?If his favorite team didn&apos;t well score?He says he wants meto read the poem againThat he couldn&apos;t stop smilingBe it highway or on the lane!I remind him that IJust yesterday, read the poem But he won&apos;t listenGoing on saying Please after my name.And that was the day my friends!The day I got to know that&apos;Archit is naughtier than naughty&apos;More than Archit Jr. who&apos;s yet to come on this planet! So I say goodbye Folks,This is how the story goesI&apos;ll go, read him next poemsuntil he makes me speechless with a rose!Previous Review:One must read Oh, The places You&apos;ll Go, I was in computer lab and had to do some programs, we were not allowed to do anything else except programming. But when the teacher was out of sight, I opened Oh, The places you&apos;ll go and at that very moment, I tell you I&apos;d been to so many places.

      Dr. Seuss is my go to author when I need to smile from the inside and out. I love reading his books to my grandchildren!
    
  
        
      Yes. And I imagine reading them to my kids with my husband. There&apos;s no doubt that Dr. Seuss brings magic in one&apos;s life and then, you yourself become magical.Oh the places you&apos;ll go is always going to be my favourite.
    
  
        
      Ah Pooja you always make me smile as though sunlight comes out from your heart.

           All my life I’ve had a outstandingly risible optimism. My Mom started me young - she gave me the ole Seuss spirit. Nevva say die, boys!Growing up, whenever authority and would-be authority would turn up the heat under my feet, I danced. An easy victim, I had faith that somehow everything would turn out - in the end. Sometimes the happy ending was just too embarrassed to show up in person in my life.I just kept on plodding.Oh, the places you’ll go! And you’ll find ‘em alright, those places -Not all of them pleasant - by ANY stretch of the imagination. But you’ll make it through the storm - and you’ll SHINE, kid!They’re forecasting rain? Well, the Kingdom of Oz is just over that rainbow... see it?When you tumble down through the roaring floodDown, down into the fearsome sluiceJust boogie on down - cause the Lord, He Loves ya! (“Ditto!” says doughty old Dr. Seuss!)Oh, the Places you’ll go...You know, these days I’m into Emily Colson’s incredible story of how she endured so many painful years of parenting a severely handicapped, hopelessly autistic son, Max.How did she cope? She realized, one landmark day, that in spite of all his tormented flaws, she deeply, hopelessly LOVED that lost little bundle of Sheer Joy!That was the day she discovered his and her Humanness. But you know what her REALLY big insight was?It came later on. Suddenly... she knew she was PROUD of this mixed-up little kid. So proud, in fact, that she wanted to take him - and her absolute doting love for him - PUBLIC!Who CARES what the bullies say or do? Love is REAL.Cause we’re ALL hopeless in our ways...And we’re ALL LOVABLE in our broken humanity, to the Big Guy up There!OH, THE PLACES YOU’LL GO!Not being perfect. Not being socially acceptable in your allotted role. Not being fixable. No.Being Human.Being just our Lost, Lovable, Flawed Selves...And that’s why the He LOVES Us. For Ourselves.And that’s how she, and I, always know EVERYTHING will be OK in the end.Oh, the PLACES WE’VE BEEN! IN SPITE OF the Grinch, the Oobleck, even that nefarious Cat in the Hat - We DID it, kid!ALL BY OURSELVES.
         
        
      I still we still own this one - packed away - butch
    
  
        
      Oops - ( not butch)... lolbut it’s been awhile since enjoying it!
    
  
        
      Elyse, I read a touching story in one of those Readers’ Digest collections about a mom who gave it to her grown son on the occasion of his leaving for university. He was nonplussed and reticent about it, while she was teary-eyed. Classic Generation Gap scenario!
    
  
        
      I learned not too long ago that this is his most sold book. That is because a lot of schools and colleges give a copy to their graduates every year.
    
  
        
      I didn’t know THAT. Thanks, Jim!
    
  
        
      Love this one, Fergus!
    
  
        
      Thanks so much, Mischenko. Dr. Seuss’ characters always seem to make it through the storms of life, ‘n we can do it too!
    
  
        
      And it is my favorite title.
    
  
        
      I have to admit it’s great, Jill, but my heart will always be with Horton &amp; the Who’s - what a message for our time THAT one is! We’re all just little Who’s in the Big Picture, I guess, but we have Voice loud enough so even the Elephants can hear!
    
  
        
      What a treasure Dr. Seuss was.
    
  
        
      🏆❗️:-)

  &quot;It&apos;s opener therein the wide open air.Out there things can happenand frequently doto people as brainyand footsy as you.And then things start to happen,don&apos;t worry. Don&apos;t stew.Just go right along.You&apos;ll start happening too.&quot;-Dr. Seuss
I had never read this book from cover to cover, but I was familiar with it from quotes used in speeches and publications. The dean of our college read us a passage to close the graduation ceremony, and even then I did not appreciate how appropriate that passage was for someone entering the real world. I had forgotten about this book until just recently when I came across a copy and began to read to pass the time. Upon finishing, I was surprised and deeply touched at how simple yet sincere the book&apos;s message was. While the book is cute and very appropriate for children, I think it takes an adult to understand and sympathize with the message. The book talks about our journey through life, with all its disappointments and happiness, its unpredictability and uncertainty. As someone who was recently faced with difficult personal and professional choices that veered from plans established years before, I especially took much of this book to heart.I will return to this book again and again in the future. It&apos;s a book that reminds you life is hard and can be lonely, but that despite the difficulties, we can all persevere. The words are simple and upbeat, but behind the colorful images is an unflinching optimism that inspires.
         
        
      i have given this to friends that moved away. i love this book.
    
  
        
      I love the book
    
  
        
      Hiking people
    
  
        
      I think that book is awesome
    
  
        
      It gives you the feeling of.... it&apos;s part of life, the ups and downs, but hold on.. it will be well worth it!
    
  
        
      :)
    
  
        
      Hi
    
  
        
      Kay, don&apos;t feel alone by the fact this was the first time reading &quot;Oh, the Places&quot; cover-to-cover. I used to use the quote &quot;And when you&apos;re in a Slump you&apos;re not in for much fun. Un-slumping yourself is not easily done&quot; to relate to a depressive state in my life, but I had never actually read the context of it either until now! I saw the quote on Tumblr much like your college dean and only just for a college project today, did I explore the narrative from cover-to-cover. Like you said, the story reminds it&apos;s readers that life is hard and can be lonely but despite those, keeping a positive attitude and looking ahead, we can get through. We tend to agree a lot on the message and meaning of this, haha. I&apos;m glad I wasn&apos;t the only with these thoughts. Also, I completely agree with that any and all age of adults understand and sympathize, empathize, with the message. How do you think little kids as audiences/readers would react? How do you think it&apos;d be different? They more focus on the imagery of hot air balloons, mountain tops, and colorful streets than the actual message (&quot;it&apos;s going to be okay&quot; - also going through yet another time in my life, this book also gave me a little bit of hope, much like you shared as well), but those are just my ideas. Would love to know yours! :)
    
  
        
      Life is go on and go on day by day, and everyday we will go to the different place, but no one and nothing can stop us. Today is your day, the world is colorful, so get power, we are ready to go to the place we will go!
    
  
        
      I have a question do you actually get to read books on good read?
    
  
        
      How do you read?
    
  
        
      Yeah how do you read
    
  
        
      I. Like. It
    
  
        
      Urv
    
  
        
      I love Dr. Seuss
    
  
        
      👍👍👍😀😁

           A gift on my high school graduation... something I will always treasure. It answers all of life&apos;s questions for a young one trying to decide their future!As a children&apos;s book, the rhyming and cartoon-like at helps keep focused attention. But it&apos;s the words that are so simple, yet so evocative in their minds. Certain stanzas stay with you. People quote it both in fun and in sincerity when thinking about what to do.It&apos;s books like this that help children figure out that reading is not just educational, it&apos;s fun. I don&apos;t have children, but I&apos;ve read it to a few younger cousins and some kids I babysat from time to time. The expressions on their face make it worth it.Give it a shot as an adult if you never did as a child.
         
        
      Well, hey! That&apos;s when I graduated from high school and I was given the same book! :)
    
  
        
      Hmmm. Maybe we know each other!
    
  
        
      As an elementary teacher for over 20 years this is a book MANY parents buy for their children as a surprise for their child to gift them upon their high school graduation. They have all their child&apos;s teachers along the way write a note in the book.

           This is my All-Time-Number-One-Favorite children&apos;s book.Period.I&apos;ve read it to my kids so many times over the years that you&apos;d think I&apos;d be immune to it by now.But I&apos;m not.I still get all EMOTIONAL when I read it. Which, normally, would make me run in the opposite direction.But.OH! THE PLACES YOU&apos;LL GO!Yo&apos;ll be on your way up!You&apos;ll be seeing great sights!You&apos;ll join the high flierswho soar to great heights.Yep. That&apos;s exactly what I want for my young&apos;uns!Wherever you fly, you&apos;ll be best of the best.Wherever you go, you will top all the rest.Except when you don&apos;t.Because, sometimes, you won&apos;t.Noooo! Now they&apos;re stuck in a LURCH!Which is pretty frickin&apos; scary for a parent! Nobody wants their babies to get stuck in a LURCH, because those inevitably lead to SLUMPS!And un-slumping yourself is not easily done.It takes a while to un-slump, and in the meantime they could end up in The Waiting Place.Waiting for the fish to biteor waiting for wind to fly a kiteor waiting around for Friday nightor waiting, perhaps, for their Uncle Jakeor a pot to boil, or a Better Breakor a string of pearls, or a pair of pantsor a wig with curls, or Another Chance.Everyone is just waiting.Thankfully, (according to Seuss) they&apos;ll somehow escape the Waiting Place.Fame! You&apos;ll be famous as famous can be, with the whole wide world watching you win on TV.Yes! They&apos;ll be ok!Except when they don&apos;t.Because, sometimes, they won&apos;t.I&apos;m afraid that some times you&apos;ll play lonely games too.Games you can&apos;t win&apos;cause you&apos;ll play against you.All alone!Whether you like it or not,Alone will be somethingyou&apos;ll be quite a lot.At this point, I&apos;m usually bleary-eyed, in case you were curious.And exactly what is this guy a Dr. of, anyway?!He&apos;s certainly not Dr. Feelgood!But on you will gothough the weather be foul.On you will go though your enemies prowl.On you will go though the Hakken-Krak howl.Onward up manya frightening creek,though your arms may get soreand your sneakers may leak.Holy Shit! What if I&apos;m not there to help them through all of this!? They&apos;ve got sore arms and leaky sneakers, for God&apos;s sake!Mommy&apos;s coming, sweetheart!You&apos;ll get mixed up, of course, as you already know.You&apos;ll get mixed up with many strange birds as you go.So be sure when you step.Step with care and great tactand remember that Life&apos;sa Great Balancing ActI&apos;m slinging snot everywhere by the time I get to this part. Seriously, Seuss? You&apos;re killing me!And will you succeed?Yes! You will, indeed!(98 and 3/4 percent guaranteed.)KID, YOU&apos;LL MOVE MOUNTAINS!I&apos;m usually nothing more a puddle of sniveling Mom-goo, as my voice cracks on the last line. And whatever unfortunate kid I happen to be reading to is simultaneously trying to comfort me, while also trying to escape my vice-like grip. &quot;I, um, love you too, Mom. *oof!* Mom, seriously, I&apos;ll be fine.*cough* Mom, you can let go now.*wheeze*Mom...you&apos;re choking me.*gurgle*Yes. Yes! I swear, I&apos;ll call you every day when I get older!&quot;
         
        
      Best review ever from the best Mom ever!!!!
    
  
        
      *blushes*Did you ever read this one to your son?
    
  
        
      No, we did read to him a lot but that wasn&apos;t one them. He wasn&apos;t that into Seuss or Disney. One of out friends gave him an old Nintendo system when he was four and he lost interest in having us read to him soon after. Because Daddy had to work, he couldn&apos;t help him read what was on the screen, so he learned to read pretty quickly. I believe he beat Legend of Zelda when he was five. Who says video games are bad for kids. Not me.
    
  
        
      Whoa! 5? He&apos;s a prodigy! I hope he&apos;s doing something with those skills now.
    
  
        
      He&apos;s a musician.
    
  
        
      Wow! That&apos;s so cool! Are we talking a band in your garage, or playing with an orchestra?
    
  
        
      Classical, although he&apos;s excellent at jazz and improvisation too. He used to post his stuff on Youtube but took it down. He was even being mentored by a few musicians from the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra too. Sadly, he&apos;s probably going to work with computers.
    
  
        
      Can&apos;t blame him for that, but it&apos;s great that he has so much talent.
    
  
        
      It&apos;s a miracle considering everything he&apos;s been (and continues to go) through.
    
  
        
      He&apos;s got a good family (I can tell) to keep him going. I&apos;m sure he&apos;s going to exceed expectations all around!

      This is the best kid&apos;s book and best review to go along with it.
    
  
        
      Thanks, Kelly! I LOVE this one. (view spoiler)[Admit it, you tear up at end...admit it! (hide spoiler)] ;)
    
  
        
      I didn&apos;t really need to read this a week and a half before my youngest gets married! He&apos;s successful in his chosen career (nurse in a neuro-spine unit at a major trauma hospital), and his fiancé is a perfect match. Still, it&apos;s hard to let them go! (The voice inside my head is even cracking!)
    
  
        
      I&apos;ll own up to that. I have two copies - the one I got as a graduation present and the one with snot all over it.

  All aboard!!!

  FASTEN YOUR SEATBELTS!

  Congratulations!

  Today is your day,

  You’re off to Great Places!

  You’re off and away!
No wonder this was the last tale by Dr. Seuss while he was alive (there are two more books, published posthumously)……and I am sure that he is now visting great places!This is a charming tale about the journey of each of us in our lives, BUT......what I really liked was that Dr. Seuss don’t lie to us.He exposes during the rhythmic narrative, that not everything will be peaches-and-ice-cream in life, that we’ll have enjoyable moments in life, BUT......also testing times, we’ll have happy events, but also sad crisis, along the journey, not matter if good or bad, if we keep walking forward, we always will be meeting new places, new people, new moments……building full and complete lives.What are you still doing here?Engage!You have places to go!!!

           Oh, The Places You&apos;ll Go!, Dr. SeussThe story begins with the narrator, relating the decision of the unnamed protagonist (who represents the reader) to leave town. The protagonist travels through several geometrical and poly-chromatic landscapes and places, eventually encountering a place simply called &quot;The Waiting Place&quot;, which is ominously addressed as being a place where everyone is always waiting for something to happen. As the protagonist continues to explore, spurred on by the thoughts of places he will visit and things he will discover, the book cheerfully concludes with an open end.تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز دهم ماه سپتامبر سال 2014 میلادیعنوان: وای، چه جاها که خواهی رفت! نویسنده: دکتر زیوس (زنوس، زوس یا سوس)؛ مترجم: رضی هیرمندی؛ تهران: افق، كتابهاي فندق، چاپ سوم ‏‫1392؛ در 32 ص؛ شابک: 9789643699185؛ چاپ چهارم 1393؛ موضوع: داستانهای نویسندگان کودکان - سده 20 مکتاب تصویری «وای چه جاها که خواهی رفت» پیامی روحیه‌ بخش در ستایش زندگی است، و به همه ی مردم، در هر سن و مرتبه‌ ای، سفارش می‌کند که یک جا ساکن نمانند، ماجراجویی کنند، و با خطرهای زندگی روبرو شوند. این کتاب به کودکان، درباره‌ ی زندگی واقعی، هوشیاری می‌دهد، و می‌گوید: زندگی پستی و بلندی‌هایی دارد، که بهتر است با همه‌ ی توان، از آن‌ها عبور کرد. دکتر «زئوس» با این داستان، به خوانشگران یادآور می‌شود، پیروزی در درون خود آن‌ها است. این کتاب بالا و پایین‌های اجتناب‌ ناپذیر زندگی را، به تصویر می‌کشد. تصویرهای کتاب فانتزی‌ هستند و در میان آن‌ها شخصیت‌ های دیگر کتاب‌های نویسنده نیز دیده می‌شوند. کتاب «وای چه جاها که خواهی رفت»، برای بلندخوانش نیز مناسب است. نقل گزیده‌ ای از کتاب: «می‌ترسم به جایی برسی بی‌فایده‌ تر از همه؛ جای انتظار کشیدن...؛ جاییکه آدم‌ها چشم به راهند و در انتظار: انتظار برای حرکت قطار یا اتوبوسی که بیاید؛ یا نامه‌ ای که برسد یا بارانی که ببارد؛ یا شنیدن یک بله یا یک نه؛ و یا انتظار برای بلندشدن موهایشان. همین‌طور دائم همه در انتظار. نه! تو اهل این حرف‌ها نیستی؛ هرطور شده فرار می‌کنی از زیر بار انتظار کشیدن و دست روی دست گذاشتن؛ جاهای شاد و روشن را پیدا خواهی کرد.»؛ پایان نقل. ا. شربیانی

           Dr. Seuss is clearly the true essence of children’s books as he writes about life in a playful and lyrical way that children can easily understand. Well, “Oh, the Places You’ll Go!” is definitely no exception as it is about believing in yourself as you go out into the world. “Oh, the Places You’ll Go!” is easily a book that every child should read whenever he or she are in a slump!Basically, this book is about taking charge of your own life facing difficulties in your life such as loneliness, fear, and confusion, with a straight face and taking on life ahead of you in a lyrical prose that children will easily appreciate!Oh my goodness! There are so many things that I loved about this book that it would take me all day to list them! For one thing, Dr. Seuss’ writing is clearly more memorable in this book as he tells children who are on their way to facing life ahead of them on their own to have positive attitudes and face their fears head on! I just loved the way that Dr. Seuss showed the upside and downside attributes of life all in a lyrical prose as the writing was truly creative and inspirational. I never would have thought that I would find a book about the tough trials of life that is so well-written and whenever I read this book, I think about the hardships I had to endure during my life, but then I realize that life always has its ups and downs and only you can decide what to make of your life, which is what Dr. Seuss has shown in this book. Probably my favorite verse in this book was this line:“I’m afraid that some times,You’ll play lonely games too.Games you can’t win,‘cause you’ll play against you.”This was a truly powerful verse for me because it is saying that there will be times where you can succeed, but sometimes when you do not believe in yourself, you end up losing the game or not succeeding at all. Dr. Seuss’ illustrations are just as creative and surreal in this book as the main character is a young boy who wears a yellow jumpsuit and a yellow hat. The world that surrounds the boy is extremely surreal as the hills and the grounds are in multicolored stripes and the creatures that the boy meets along the way are also bizarre, especially of the image of the boy meeting a huge green monster that has black stripes on its body and short yellow bushy tail.All in all, “Oh, the Places You’ll Go!” is easily one of Dr. Seuss’ best works ever created and it should be read to any child who graduates from school! I would recommend this book to children ages three and up since there is nothing inappropriate in this book.Review is also on: Rabbit Ears Book Blog
         
        
      Oh, Dr. Seuss! How many of us can recite his books by heart? I loved this book, it was one of my favorites.

  ”You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself any direction you choose.” 
I was not expecting a kid’s book to be so incredibly profound?? This picture book follows an unnamed narrator (“You”) as they take off on the journey called life. This journey takes them through indecision, anxiety, loneliness and failure—- but also excitement, triumph and happiness.This was a really beautiful story. I loved that it wasn’t sugar-coating things for kids. Seuss understood that hard times would happen, and he wanted kids to prepare without being scared. the end result is perfectly balanced. While I loved it, the four-year-old I was reading to also loved it. The illustrations, rhyming and general excitement keep the story interesting. The rhyme-scheme flowed very well and the word-play was fun. I didn’t mind reading this one each time small-fry asked.Kid Lit Experiment 2018 #5

           	”You mean there’s a catch?”“Sure there’s a catch, “ Doc Daneeka replied. “Catch-22. Anyone who wants to get out of combat duty isn’t really crazy.”There was only one catch and that was Catch-22, which specified that a concern for one’s own safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind. Orr was crazy and could be grounded. All he had to do was ask; and as soon as he did, he would no longer be crazy and would have to fly more missions. Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he didn’t, but if he was sane he had to fly them. If he flew them he was crazy and didn’t have to; but if he didn’t want to he was sane and had to. Yossarian was moved very deeply by the absolute simplicity of this clause of Catch-22 and let out a respectful whistle. “That’s some catch, that Catch-22,” He observed.“It’s the best there is,” Doc Daneeka agreed.
  
Originally Catch-22 was Catch-18, but because Leon Uris was publishing a novel called Mila-18 that same year Joseph Heller’s agent decided the title needed to be changed so as to not confuse the book buying public. Also given that 22 is a double 11 they liked the way it represented the many déjà vu moments that occur in the book. The East Coast publishing intelligentsia really embraced the book even though there were doubts if it would ever gain traction with the American public. It did.I understand the frustration that publishers feel with the American book buying public. They have all been scorched by a book they felt should have sold by the wheelbarrow only to have it crash and burn with the majority of the first printing sold off to a remainder company. Sometimes a book needs a lightning strike in the form of Oprah or a school banning the book (thank-you Strongsville, OH), but for Heller all he needed was the 1960s. The book is set during WWII, the last good war according to everyone from Tom Brokaw to the school janitor at Phillipsburg High School. Fat novels glorifying the war, some extraordinarily good, were hitting bookstores at a fast clip from the late 1940s on. By the time Catch-22 came out in 1961 the world had changed. So those people who bought this book who thought they were in for another “weren’t we great” novel about World War Two were in for a shock. A typical reaction was:WTF????Some thought it was irreverent, but there were a growing group of people who thought it was among the best American novels they had ever read. Both reactions helped juice the novel and sales began to climb. 
  
Joseph Heller in uniform.At the tender age of 19 in 1942 Joseph Heller joined the U.S. Army Air Corp. By 1944 he found himself on the Italian Front as a B-25 Bombardier. He flew 60 missions most of which he categorized as milk runs; these were flight missions that encounter no or very little anti-aircraft artillery or enemy fighters. Heller admits that his disillusionment with the war in Korea colored the novel. It gives me the shakes to think how different the novel would be if he had published the book in 1951 instead of 1961. Little did he know how prophetic his novel would be regarding the Vietnam War. Yossarian has reached the end of his rope. He has flown the required number of combat missions several times, but each time Colonel Cathcart keeps raising the number of missions required to go home. A similar circumstance plagued Hawkeye Pierce and his fellow doctors in the Korean War based TV series M*A*S*H. The pressure of thousands of people he doesn’t even know and hundreds he does know trying to kill him is just too much for him to bear. As he becomes more and more insane(sane) he becomes more and more qualified to fly combat missions as far as the military is concerned. He comes up with various ailments to keep him in the hospital. He shows up to receive his war medal naked except for a pair of moccasins. He finally refuses to fly any more missions and begins parading around the camp walking backwards. This does start to foment rebellion among his fellow flyers and drives Colonel Cathcart to distraction. ”Morale was deteriorating and it was all Yossarian’s fault. The country was in peril; he was jeopardizing his traditional rights of freedom and independence by daring to exercise them.”Heller surrounds Yossarian with a wonderful cast of detailed characters of which I will only be able to mention a few. Lieutenant Nately is one of Yossarian’s best friends, a trust fund baby with red, white, and blue blood running through his veins. He is a good looking kid and could have any woman he wanted, but he falls in love with an Italian prostitute who begrudgingly sleeps with him when he pays for sex with her, but would rather he just disappeared. He has this great discussion with her “107” year old pimp. ”Italy is one of the least prosperous nations on earth. And the Italian fighting man is probably second to all. And that’s exactly why my country is doing so well in this war while your country is doing so poorly.”Nately guffawed with surprise...”But Italy was occupied by the Germans and is now being occupied by us. You don’t call that doing very well, do you?”“But of course I do.” exclaimed the old man cheerfully. “The Germans are being driven out, and we are still here. In a few years you will be gone, too, and we will still be here. You see, Italy is really a very poor and weak country, and that’s what makes us so strong. Italian soldiers are not dying any more. But American and German soldiers are. I call that doing extremely well.”Nately continues to be the straight man for the old man as they discuss the absurdity of risking one’s life for their country.	”There is nothing so absurd about risking your life for your country.” he (Nately) declared.“Isn’t there?”asked the old man. “What is a country? A country is a piece of land surrounded on all sides by boundaries, usually unnatural. Englishmen are dying for England, Americans are dying for America, Germans are dying for Germany, Russians are dying for Russia. There are now fifty or sixty countries fighting in this war. Surely so many countries can’t all be worth dying for.”“Anything worth living for,” said Nately, “is worth dying for.”“And anything worth dying for,” answered the sacrilegious old man. “is certainly worth living for.”Milo Minderbinder is in charge of the mess at the U.S. Army Corps base. As he learns more and more about how goods are moved around the globe he begins a business of supply and demand (war profiteering). He becomes the ultimate capitalist with no allegiance to any country. He trades with the enemy and as part of contract negotiations he also warns the Germans once of an impending attack even to the point of guiding anti-artillery against American planes and in another case bombs his own base to fulfill another contract. The absurdity of his position is that he is too important to the American high command to get in trouble for any of these acts of treason. He tries to explain one of his more successful schemes to Yossarian. 	”I don’t understand why you buy eggs for seven cents apiece in Malta and sell them for five cents.”“I do it to make a profit.”“But how can you make a profit? You lose two cents an egg.”“But I make a profit of three and a quarter cents an egg by selling them for four and a quarter cents an egg to the people in Malta I buy them from for seven cents an egg. Of course, I don’t make the profit. the syndicate makes the profit. And everybody has a share.”Yossarian felt he was beginning to understand. “And the people you sell the eggs to at four anda quarter cents a piece make a profit of two and three quarter cents apiece when they sell them back to you at seven cents apiece. Is that right? Why don’t you sell the eggs directly to you and eliminate the people you buy them from?”“Because I’m the people I buy them from.” Milo explained. “I make a profit of three and a quarter cents apiece when I sell them to me and a profit of two and three quarter cents apiece when I buy them back from me. That’s a total profit of six cents and egg. I lose only two cents an egg when I sell them to the mess halls at five cents apiece, and that’s how I can make a profit buying eggs for seven cents apiece and selling them for five cents apiece.Hungry Joe keeps meeting the flight standards time and time again only to have his paperwork take too long to process before the flight standards have been raised again. He packs and then he unpacks. He is a fat, pervert who convinces women to take their clothes off to be photographed by telling them that he works for Life Magazine and will put them on the cover. Unfortunately the photographs never turn out. Ironically he did work as a photographer for Life Magazine before the war. Women do play a role in this book mostly as objects of lust. Heller has these wonderful, creative descriptions of them. ”She would have been perfect for Yossarian, a debauched, coarse, vulgar, amoral, appetizing slattern whom he had longed for and idolized for months. She was a real find. She paid for her own drinks, and she had an automobile, an apartment and a salmon-colored cameo ring that drove Hungry Joe clean out of his senses with its exquisitely carved figures of a naked boy and girl on a rock.”And then there is a nurse that brings Yossarian nearly to his knees with desire. ”Yossarian was sick with lust and mesmerized with regret. General Dreedle’s nurse was only a little chubby, and his senses were stuffed to congestion with the yellow radiance of her hair and the unfelt pressure of her soft short fingers, with the rounded untasted wealth of her nubile breast in her Army-pink shirt that was opened wide at the the throat and with the rolling, ripened triangular confluences of her belly and thighs in her tight, slick forest-green garbardine officer’s pants. He drank her in insatiably from head to painted toenail. He never wanted to lose her. ‘Ooooooooooooh,’ he moaned again, and this time the whole room rippled at his quavering, drown-out cry.”.You will probably need to google the next one. ”He enjoyed Nurse Sue Ann Druckett’s long white legs and supple, callipygous ass.”Paradoxes abound even when Heller describes a character he will have countering characteristics like she was plain, but pretty or he was handsome, but ugly. Aren’t we all a sum of those characteristics anyway?
  
Joseph Heller looking handsome and ugly.This book is hilarious, (I laughed out loud at several points.)but wrapped with increasingly more tragic circumstances. As Yossarian’s friends die or disappear his desperation increases. His behavior becomes more and more erratic. The absurd traps him time and time again. There are a whole host of reasons why everyone should read this novel. I’m not saying that everyone will like it as much as I did, but it is IMHO one of the top five most important American novels ever written. It impacted our culture, added words to our language, and gave voice to a generation of people dissatisfied with the war aims of this country. More importantly don’t be the one person in the middle of a Catch-22 discussion who hasn’t read the book.

      I am the one who hasn&apos;t read the book Jeffrey, but after reading your review I&apos;ll make sure that I do. I&apos;m pretty curious as how a novel dealing with the brutality and the insanity of war could make one laugh out loud. Tragicomic and with an underlying cynical approach, I guess...Loved the conversation about what a stupid thing is to risk a life for a piece of land with unnatural boundaries. Fantastic review.
    
  
        
      &quot;Callipygous,&quot; lolz...that makes me laugh out loud right there.I think you&apos;re right, Jeffrey; I think it does belong in the top five American novels. To that I&apos;ll add Moby Dick, and I&apos;ll let smarter people puzzle out the remaining three!

I&apos;m glad because the meaning was priceless. Yes, I just want to imagine you (or one of these guys) using that word at say, a cocktail party. No one would dare ask &quot;What does that mean?&quot; not wanting to sound stupid. Very, very funny and glad you made note to share it. You captured the essence of the book so well here. Great review, great reviewer and great book. A triple, no, no, a home run for sure.

      This is a great review of a great classic. Not everybody gets it. I remember reading some funny passages out loud one morning around breakfast to my wife&apos;s family, thinking I was doing everyone a favor by spreading some good humor into an otherwise dull morning. Based on their reaction, you would have guessed I burnt the flag or picketed a soldier&apos;s funeral, like the Westboro cult. Heller, and me by liking it, seemed subversive and unpatriotic to them. But of course not of them had served a day in their life and so they are totally disconnected from reality of military life, which can definitely be absurd at times. Heller was a great patriot though he light of it by linking it with matriarchy.

      I always thought that the book was hilarious, but only up to a point, roughly half way through. My recollection, having read it about 45 years ago, is that at that point it got very dark. I probably missed some of the absurdities that you spoke of in the latter part of the book, Jeffrey. And I&apos;m not saying I didn&apos;t like that part, just that the laugh-out-loud moments ended rather abruptly for me somewhere in there.My vague impression (what I&apos;ve carried forward) is that the first part of the book took place in sunshine, while the second part was in bad weather or nighttime. I&apos;m probably just making that up.As I recall (simply from reading about it, I never saw it) the movie followed this trajectory also, or at least so I imagined. I think the turning point in the movie between humor and &quot;horror&quot; (or possibly as you state it, the &quot;absurd&quot;) was when the fellow on the life raft is shaved in half by the prop of the plane flying low over the water. (I don&apos;t remember the names of the characters involved.)

I find this book very accessible. I was shocked to find out how much I&apos;d forgotten. As I&apos;ve mentioned in the thread earlier I need to reread it more often 20+ years is too long between reads. I was glad to see you mention the patriotism of Heller in your comment. He was certainly a patriot even though those who found the book irreverent did not believe so. If he had set the book in Korea instead of WW2 the backlash probably would have been less. WW2 has almost been canonized as sacred ground, but without the controversy would Catch-22 be a part of our language today. Thanks Steve.

The pilot then flies his plane into a mountain. What I&apos;m still working through is as the book progresses all these horrible things keep happening, but there is a veneer over all of it. I found myself stopping and reassessing all that had happened because Heller would quickly move to something absurd after something tragic. It is a balancing act that he handles very well. As the book moves forward though and more and more of Yossarian&apos;s friends are dead or missing the reader can&apos;t help to share some of that load. There is really good news regarding Orr at the end that helps lift the book in the final pages.

Maybe I can be more compelling in print than in person.

           I suffered through about 60 pages, and finally put it down. I very rarely ever leave a book unfinished. The author narrates and introduces us to Yossarian, who does not want to fly in the war. I get that. I get the whole catch 22 scenerio... You have to be insane to fly the plane. If you can get a dr to say you are insane, you wont have to fly. But in order to tell a dr that you are insane, this actually means you are sane. So you must continue to fly... which makes you insane. blah blah blah.What I couldnt get past was the author&apos;s constant bouts of Attention Deficet Disorder.... He went off on tangents, introducing a new character seemingly every paragraph, and seemed to lose his train of thought only to regain it 2 pages later. I couldnt take all the jumping around, and was completely lost the whole time... at times rereading the prior page thinking I missed some important tie-in somewhere....Am I the only one on this planet who is asking myself what heck everyone was smoking when they read this book and actually enjoyed it?
         
        
      No, Lori, you are NOT &quot;the only one on this planet who is asking myself what heck everyone is smoking when they read this book and actually enjoyed it?...&quot;There are a few of us who admit that we think Catch-22 is a stinker. Its not a popular opinion among &quot;book nerds&quot;.So goes life.
    
  
        
      Putting the term book nerds in sarcastic quotation marks on a social network about books is hilarious. To your point Lori, no you aren&apos;t the only person who didn&apos;t like it my girlfriend hated it! But I read the book when I was a teenager and now I re-read it every couple of years, it resonates in a different way every time. If it was a book that everybody enjoyed I don&apos;t think I&apos;d find it as special.
    
  
        
      As a writer (and remembering the book from years ago), the jumping around is partly because he&apos;s injured and is writing in character. If you read Marilynne Robinson&apos;s Gilead, a Pulitzer Prize winner, and beautifully written, the narrator is a 76 year old Presbyterian minister and he rambles and repeats himself because he is that old. I admit, war books are hard to read. Try Into the Lake of the Woods by Tim O&apos;Brien, a Viet Nam veteran, who writes powerful stuff about that time and place, but in interesting ways, not battlefront. 
    
  
      Trust me, you&apos;re not the only one.If I was to write a review on this book, this would be exactly it, word for word.I only got to about page 60 aswell before I lost all hope of ever liking this book.
    
  
        
      I think that reading 60 pages of a book and then putting it down hardly qualifies you to claim that you read it and disliked it. Actually, you &quot;sampled it,&quot; and you didn&apos;t like what you sampled; that&apos;s more appropriate. I didn&apos;t like it at 60 pages in, either, but the book has over 450 pages. Read more and then write a scathing review, if you feel so inclined. 
    
  
        
      Alison, I am not sure what part of my review you consider &quot;Scathing&quot;. I think I stated my feelings on it. And 60 pages definitely qualifies as &quot;reading and disliking&quot; in my opinion. Yeah, I said opinion. Because that is all it is. I&apos;m expressing to anyone who cares to read my review why I was unable to continue reading that horrific dribble. Thanks for your opinion. Yeah, I said opinion. and since it&apos;s only an opinion, I don&apos;t have to agree with you. See how easy that was? Just choose not to agree with me. After all, it&apos;s only an opinion. 
    
  
        
      Haha, okay, fair enough. Don&apos;t you think you should give it more of a chance, though? Perhaps I just have an OCD-tendency or something to finish everything before I feel that I&apos;m able to comment on it. Maybe that&apos;s wrong. You&apos;re definitely entitled to your opinion. I&apos;m not in love with this book, either, honestly, but I&apos;m trying to reserve judgment until it&apos;s complete, because I think there&apos;s something to be said for reviewing the work as a whole. But yeah, if you can&apos;t get through it, you just can&apos;t, I guess.
    
  
        
      thanks Alison. I very rarely give up on books. It&apos;s sort of an OCD thing with me as well. If you check out my bookshelves, you will see there have only ever been three that I stopped reading. Which just proves the point even more to me.... it was just not my type of novel. And I think I am pretty open to any genre.Oh well. Cant read and love em all!
    
  
        
      you are not alone. this book annoyed the piss out of me. i grew up military. i get the jokes. they&apos;re just not funny the way heller tells them. in fact, they feel contrived and forced down my throat. like an episode of family guy, where they keep repeating the same bad joke over and over and over till the audience finds it funny.i think the crabapple story is what made me finally lose it.
    
  
        
      I have attempted to read this book on two separate occasions and I couldn&apos;t get beyond 100 pages either time. I do believe that this has more to do with me than the book and I plan on making a third attempt at some point in the future. But it is comforting to know that others were just as perplexed as I was.Currently it sits on my bookshelf and sometimes (when I have a few too many beers) we have a talk. Me: Hi. Catch-22: Oh, hi.Me: How are you feeling?Catch-22: I&apos;ve been better.Me: Don&apos;t be upset. It&apos;s not you. It&apos;s me.Catch-22: I know that. Me: My friends tell me I&apos;m an idiot for ending our relationship.Catch-22: I agree.Me: I&apos;m sure the reason I don&apos;t laugh or enjoy myself when I&apos;m with you has more to do with my own flaws than with yours.Catch-22: Of course. I&apos;m flawless.Me: I don&apos;t know if I would go that far.Catch-22: Well, you&apos;ve already admitted that it&apos;s your fault so I don&apos;t know if you&apos;re the best person to be judging whether or not I&apos;m flawed.Me: Hey, now! I didn&apos;t laugh once when I was with you.Catch-22: I&apos;ve been forced to sit on this bookshelf for years while you plop in front of the TV to laugh at Will Ferrell movies. I&apos;ll give you Anchorman but Step Brothers? Don&apos;t talk to me about what is or isn&apos;t funny.Me: The sleepwalking scene in that movie is pure genius!Catch-22: I rest my case.Me: Ok, ok. You&apos;re right. I promise you that one day I&apos;ll be mature and enlightened enough to appreciate you and when that day comes, you and I will have some fun together.Catch-22: I won&apos;t hold my breath.
    
  
        
      Chris, that was priceless :)
    
  
        
      Thanks, Lori. I never got around to writing a review for this book, so maybe I&apos;ll use what I wrote here.
    
  
        
      I think its very fitting... you should!
    
  
        
      Its the best book I&apos;ve ever read. The multitude of characters speak volumes - it is their idiosyncricies (spl?) which make the book. Personal favourites of mine are Yossarian, The Chaplain, and of course Major Major Major Major.There are two many incidents in the book that made me roar with laughter. The sheer absurdity made me shudder with loud, uncontrollable bursts of insane and inconsolable mirth. 
    
  
        
      well, i am glad i am not the insane one. there is definitely comfort in knowing others feel the same as me. however, i am going to force myself to finish the book if it kills me which is something Yossarin might find amusing in itself!
    
  
        
      The skipping around is a very purposeful style. Heller gives you a taste of what is going on and then he adds a little something new to the story. Then he takes you back to the same scene and reveals a little more then adds some new twist to the plot. He&apos;s weaving a story. He goes back over the same scenes at least five times, and every time he comes back you get to understand the situation better. The first three hours of reading this book are just about unbearable because it&apos;s all so difficult to understand. He&apos;s brushing lightly over the surface of the plot. But stick with it and you&apos;ll be glad you did.
    
  
        
      I didn&apos;t start liking the book until halfway through. The first half was hard because I got all the characters confused. But I got the hang of it about halfway through. I was glad I didn&apos;t put it down because at about 30 pages it I almost did. It was good in my opinion.
    
  
        
      Nice. I&apos;m a fool for not liking a book that is disorganised and chaotic. Thanks for pointing that out. I would have wandered through the remainder of my life not knowing what the fuck was wrong with me. I owe you. Really. I&apos;m a fool... huh.

      Chris wrote: &quot;I have attempted to read this book on two separate occasions and I couldn&apos;t get beyond 100 pages either time.

No one is supposed to get or like every book, just as no one is supposed to get or like every painting, piece of music or movie. I loved Catch-22, but I couldn&apos;t get past page 100 of Zen and The Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, and I&apos;ve tried three times. Does that mean Zen is crap? Or that there must be something wrong with people who like it? Or -heaven forbid- something wrong with me because I didn&apos;t? No, just means it didn&apos;t connect with me as a person.Anyway, I just felt the need to comment on your sentiment, because it stood out to me as a shining beacon of maturity in a sea of name calling.Not to mention your conversation with the book was hysterical.
    
  
        
      I wonder how those who don&apos;t like Heller&apos;s Catch-22 do with Kafka? The two are fighting some of the same battles. Another speculation: Maybe those who like Catch-22 have experienced life in the gears of an absurd bureaucracy, and those who don&apos;t like it have never had the pleasure....?
    
  
        
      i&apos;m sorry, but pages is not nearly enough to have read in order to properly form an opinion on this book. but i do agree, it&apos;s not for everyone (i however, loved it). 
    
  
        
      I dont think I really had much of an &quot;opinion&quot; on it. Just explaining why I was unable to finish it. 
    
  
        
      Hmmmm, that statement always makes me wonder why can&apos;t you? The author has just a few pages to snag our attention or not. We are constantly forming opinions of books we think we&apos;ll like, or not, based on genre, author and sometimes opening paragraghs. I detested Lawrence&apos;s Lady Chatterley&apos;s Lover and knew fairly early on it wasn&apos;t my kind of book but stuck with it because it was important literature. That&apos;s time I&apos;ll never get back reading a book I loathed.There&apos;s been many a time that a book has failed to engage my interest and reading through to the end never improves that opinion.I think it&apos;s essential for there to be room for differences of opinion, for honest, heartfelt criticism,especially when it comes to the &quot;important&quot; books. I&apos;ve learned as much from a book that has been criticized as I have from those that have been praised. All thoughts and feelings are based on personal experience and are valid.
    
  
        
      Sherry, that is very well put. While I try to remain open to books, regardless of genre, certain books just do not hold well with me. Believe it or not, classics tend to be the ones I struggle with most. Turn of the Screw, Wuthering Hieghts, Heart of Darkness - Those are novels that I read cover to excrucating cover, and like you mention, all that wasted time I will never get back!!!I took my cue on this one... rereading the first 40 pages three times is a MAJOR sign to put the book down and back away... before I do something I will regret :)
    
  
        
      I&apos;m with you on Turn of the Screw. Grueling!
    
  
        
      I understand where you&apos;re coming from, but honestly just read the stupid book all the way through without worrying about understanding 100% of it because that&apos;s nearly impossible. This is one of the funniest and most clever books I have ever read.
    
  
        
      Catch-22 is one of my favourite books, but I completely get that it&apos;s not to everyone&apos;s taste. For me, though, the jumping around and &quot;ADD&quot; is one of my favourite things about the book - you&apos;re not really supposed to know what&apos;s going on, no one does, and that&apos;s kinda the point, but the more you keep reading, the more everything comes together. I also have to say that I find Heller&apos;s ability to jump backwards and forwards in the timeline and eventually weave it all together is incredibly skilled and innovative - it may be confusing to start with, but personally I found it worth sticking with to the end, and with a re-read it all seems perfectly logical (in an insane sort of way). On a tangent, what&apos;s with people taking other people&apos;s differing opinions as a personal attack? Some people have different taste to others, deal! If someone says they don&apos;t like something that you happen to like, this is not an attack on you, it is a statement of opinion. Jeez. 
    
  
        
      As many people have already pointed out I think that forming an opinion on this particular book when having not finished it is unfair. The book is very hard to read at the beginning but you soon get used to it. I originally hated the book but grow to love it. I think anyone who sticks with the book will grow to at least rate it more then one star.
    
  
        
      Basically, the &quot;ADD&quot; thing that you criticize is not, as one may think, a mistake nor is the author &quot;loosing his train of thought&quot;. That&apos;s just the style of narration he chose for that book. Do you only ever read book with tightly-knit plots? I know I don&apos;t, and I had no trouble following through this one. It&apos;s like puzzle pieces, he adds one at a time in different places. This book is, in fact, my favourite book ever and no, I don&apos;t smoke crack, not even pot ;). PS If you ever try to read it again, look at it as if someone had just come back from a weird place and is trying to tell you as much about that place as possible. He starts wherever it&apos;s easy for him, sometimes describes characters, sometimes events. Sometimes he remembers a (seemingly) completely unrelated story. If you think that way, you&apos;ll see that the book is, in fact, far from chaotic ;). There are some great (and absurd) mysteries too ;). Still, it&apos;s quite possible you will not like this book. Some people just don&apos;t get it, it requires a certain sense of humour and I guess a certain personality ;). My mum couldn&apos;t finish it - she&apos;s more of a serious person and likes her books to be beautifully written or to have a very engaging plot - and preferably at least one likable character ;). (historical/classics/crime/thriller etc.) If you&apos;re like her, no point wasting your time :).
    
  
        
      I agree with you Lori. You are not alone. I struggled to read up to 100 pages of this book. Like it has been said before it&apos;s a matter of taste and everyone is entitled to an opinion and I may not have an extensive list of books that I&apos;ve read like other members on this site but I rarely stop reading a book once I&apos;ve started and 60 or even 100 pages should be more than enough to find out if you should stick with a book or not. Yes, I did find Heller to be humorous at times but felt this book was exremely redundent. Maybe in the future I&apos;ll try again. 
    
  
        
      While I think you have to read the whole thing to appreciate this book, I don&apos;t think everyone who gave up on it should be forced to finish it. It either holds your interest long enough or it doesn&apos;t. I read it not knowing one thing about it, and it all came together perfectly for me and became easily my favorite book. I love it but that doesn&apos;t mean everyone has to. It also doesn&apos;t mean you&apos;re a simpleton if you don&apos;t love it. I&apos;m just glad it brings me such great enjoyment.
    
  
        
      you should chizzeck out my review. I think i know where you&apos;re coming from, this book definitely takes some patience. Personally my patience didn&apos;t pay off until about 150 or so pages to go, when he actually starts tying all the random stuff together so that it actually makes sense, which i thought he did brilliantly and really appreciated it even more because of how frustrated i was starting to get at that point. personally, i thought it was well-worth it to stick it out. but yeah, that&apos;s just me. So if you do stick it out and still wind up hating it, my bad!
    
  
        
      I get how you could feel that way- in the beginning I just wanted to put the thing down. I had a deadline to read it too, which just made it all the worst (I&apos;m studying it for school).I hated how it jumped around, I couldn&apos;t tell when it was half the time, all the characters were confusing and it just rambled on forever.However, I stuck with it and now I&apos;m glad I did, because I truly think it is one of the most influential books I have ever read. By the end I was laughing my arse off at it, and I was geniunley upset when it finished, yet satisfied.Looking back now, the book is one of the most amazing ever written, and the quality never staggers. I don&apos;t wonder how it became famous, I fell in love with each and every character and it did get easier to read- in fact I also realised it is meant to confuse you. It&apos;s meant to make absolutley no sense, but as you go along it&apos;s like little puzzle peices are being fitted together, until in the end it just ties up into something amasing.In the end, I was putty to everything that amazing stack of words on paper was telling me....So, if you ever have some free time...I&apos;d suggest giving it another go.
    
  
        
      I love, love, love, love Catch-22... it makes me laugh so hard. It&apos;s too bad you didn&apos;t enjoy it, maybe try it again without taking it too seriously.
    
  
        
      pot, their smoking pot.
    
  
        
      Lori, I hated the book as well and didn&apos;t get anywhere near finishing it. If I&apos;m not enjoying a book I move on to something else as there are too many books out there to waste time on something you hate-and I don&apos;t see why I should struggle through to the end before I&apos;m given &apos;permission&apos; to review it here. Reading is about &apos;personal&apos; enjoyment and everyone likes different things. I&apos;m getting tired of being called spiteful names and getting threatening emails from irate goodreads readers because I dare to give MY opinion on MY reading experience of a book. When I review a book and say I hate it, I&apos;m not telling everyone else not to read the thing!!! I&apos;m not saying that everyone who loved this book has something wrong with them!!! I don&apos;t get mad when people disagree with me but I do get mad when they think it is ok to call me a moron or a retarded bitch because I don&apos;t like a book!(yes I have been called that for not liking Bree Tanner)Why can&apos;t everyone just respect our right to not like a damn book???
    
  
        
      I loved the book. There were parts - like the one with crab-apples in Orr&apos;s cheeks, or Yossarian&apos;s debate with the colonel&apos;s wife in bed on God, that had me laughing till I literally fell of my chair with tears in my eyes. I thought it was brilliant and original.
    
  
        
      &quot;Am I the only one on this planet who is asking myself what heck everyone is smoking when they read this book and actually enjoyed it?&quot;No, you&apos;re not. I bought this book after a journalist I admired wrote that it was the best book of the last 100 years.I had to struggle to finish. I didn&apos;t get the earth-shattering humour. I&apos;ll probably try again some day, but I doubt it. Too many other books out there that I actually &apos;do&apos; enjoy reading.
    
  
        
      Too bad - it&apos;s books fault that it&apos;s hard to read - not yours! It&apos;s funny how you don&apos;t like the bits of it that make it so unique - it&apos;s like saying that Requiem for a Dream is just too hard of a movie to watch - so it MUST be disorganised, horrible music, too much drugs and in that sense - bad.But - it&apos;s a personal review and everybody here should take it as that. You are no fool not to like this book - it&apos;s a personal opinion of one; just part of statistics. Funny though - you liked good omens and that book has a lot of hidden nuggets just like this one. You do have to get used to broken timeline that is depending on plot and not the other way around.
    
  
        
      Loved your review.Yep, it&apos;s all just opinion. I haven&apos;t gone into reviewers&apos; comments too often, and now that I am, I&apos;m starting to wonder if they should be moderated just to reduce name-calling. Totally childish. State your opinion, offer advice, give suggestions, disagree, but personal attacks shouldn&apos;t be in the game.Like you, I wondered WHO was calling this a great book! I didn&apos;t make it past the 1st disc of the audio version, and, like you, I rarely stop a book I&apos;ve begun. I love Goodreads, because without it, I would have stopped right here. Actually, I already did, and i also gave Catch-22 a rating of 1. Reading the comments of those who loved it have caused me to reconsider, and I may try again, and stick with it longer. For me, that it isn&apos;t the jumping around or the number of characters that bother me. I saw that as the author&apos;s choice, intending to set the stage for the character&apos;s state of mind. In my case, it&apos;s the &quot;humor&quot; that bugs me. I don&apos;t know what it is about it, or if it&apos;s just the style of writing that doesn&apos;t sit well with me, but I haven&apos;t laughed or enjoyed any of it yet. I just find it really irritating. Someone said it tries too hard. That seems closer. Hah - I liked the Kafka reference - interesting!! I can&apos;t deal with Kafka either. Couldn&apos;t make it through &quot;The Castle&quot;. I like the premise and subject of his work, but the writing makes me squirm. When I read him, I just don&apos;t &quot;get&quot; him. It&apos;s all personal.Then again, I hated the Grapes of Wrath, and if I hadn&apos;t been listening to it on a long car ride, I would have quit early on. I actually yelled at the book a few times - &quot;Hey, you&apos;re killing me! You&apos;re supposed to be keeping me awake! If I die because you put me to sleep, it&apos;s your fault!!&quot; Yelling at it kept me awake. I stuck with it only out of desperation. I was so glad I did, by the end I thought it was one of the best books I had ever read. So it happens. Maybe it will happen to me again, this time with Catch-22. And if it doesn&apos;t, I&apos;ll get over it. Life&apos;s too short.
    
  
        
      I liked the book, but I agree it is not for everyone. I take the absurdity as more the narrator&apos;s state of mind. Sort of like someone with advanced PTSD or dementia trying to remember something. If you were to look into the mind of someone with advanced mental illness it would be something like this. Of course this could not be the way things really happened if the MC were real, we know that, but it could be someone&apos;s perception of the way things happened.I didn&apos;t see it as humor so much as absurdity, but not just absurdity for the sake of it. I admire anyone who can do absurdity well, since I tend to be so logical myself.Of course, this is like modern art. One person looks and says, &quot;What amazing creativity!&quot; Another person says, &quot;My five year old can draw better than that!&quot;
    
  
        
      Personally this one of my favourite books ever. It is a bit like a Monty Python movie; the humour is subtle through its absurdity; outrageous yet also very intelligent. Like Monty Python I wouldn&apos;t bother trying to work out a coherent story, it is more like a series of sketches filled with wonderful satire.I have watched Python movies with people who have not stopped laughing from start to finish, while the person next to him didn’t break a smile. I suppose Catch 22 is like that, the sense of humour either hits a chord with you or it doesn’t. And if you don&apos;t get the humour, the book becomes irrelevant. The only advice I would give people who didn’t enjoy it and are wanting to give this another go, is to treat each chapter like a short story and ride with it. Don&apos;t try too hard to find a definite story, the catch 22 situation is not the crux of the story ,rather it is just one of many absurd situations that the narrator finds himself in. If you still don&apos;t like the first 60 pages you will not like the rest so you may as well stop reading.
    
  
        
      This is my favorite book, but all but two of the people that have read it on my recommendation have been unable to finish it. It&apos;s not an easy read. As someone above suggested, you can&apos;t really focus on trying to keep track of plot/characters at first because it is supposed to be nonsense. It&apos;s an impressionistic work that needs to sink in, and that takes time. So keeping all the characters straight and the timeline in order is really not important. However, if that&apos;s going to annoy you, then it&apos;s probably not for you. No book is for everyone. I thought the Road is one of the most boring books I ever read (luckily for me, that whole novel can probably be read in less time than even 60 pages of this one).As to the humor, it does seem underwhelming or juvenile at first. But again, patience is absolutely necessary for this novel. As it progresses and you begin to grasp the rhythms of the story and the characters, those seemingly silly logic games take a very dark turn. What seems like childish nonsense begins to be outright horrific in its consequences... and that is the true power of this book. Once it sinks in, you begin to really start thinking about how easily our society accepts terrifyingly inhumane outcomes without ever really exploring just how flimsy and bizarre the underlying logic for them is.
    
  
        
      I actually sort of liked the way that you had to keep going.You just sort of had to finish the whole book to be able to absorb the whole story,since it&apos;s timeline seems to be all over the place.But it makes it seem more surreal,in my opinion.But I understand that people also like to read books that don&apos;t make you continue a book without all the facts.
    
  
        
      Lori, I only made it to page 40. I also had a problem with all the jumping around and so many characters being introduced so quickly.
    
  
        
      I couldn&apos;t go beyond 100 pages the first time. I have picked up this book again now. Let&apos;s see if I enjoy it this time around.
    
  
        
      I do accept that this book is hard to go along, but u cant give it a single star rating just because of tht. Believe me, u d feel much better when u finish this book...:)
    
  
        
      just started reading this book and yes, there are so many tangents! I hope I can make myself finish it...
    
  
        
      Never read &quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot; by Faulkner then. I personal really dig sort of thing, it&apos;s kinda like a field I must plow through in order to get to the soil that&apos;s really gonna make things grow. There&apos;s usually a payoff. I am really insterested about this book now, thank you.

A shiny new batch of awesome for my &quot;all time favorite&quot; shelf. It has been awhile since I’ve so throughly enjoyed reading a novel that has, at the same time, left me as intellectually awestruck as Joseph Heller’s classic sermon on the insanity of war. What a sublime, literary feast. To prepare:1. Start with a surrealistic, Kafkaesque worldview basted in chaos;2. Knead in a plot reminiscent of Pynchon, taking particular care that the bizarre, placidly disjointed surface fully camouflages the powerfully nuanced, and deceptively focused central message; 3. Marinate the whole thing in a dark, hilarious satire that would have made Vonnegut beam like a proud papa. 4. Bake at 350, season with zesty prose, and serve. Voila...a singular, absurdilarious serving of inspired genius that I can not recommend more highly. This novel was so much more than I was expecting. Despite its pervasive, laugh out loud humor, Heller’s story is the most horrifyingly effective depiction of the insanity of war that I’ve ever read**. I’m not referring to the evil and vile atrocities perpetrated in war that have been so extensively catalogued throughout the annals of literature. Rather, Heller&apos;s insight is geared to showing us the illogic of war, the out-of-control nihilism, and the chaotic, existential absurdity of it.**Note: this observation is coming from someone who’s never been closer to war than the opening scene of Saving Private Ryan, so season the above with grains of salt as necessary. It&apos;s brilliant.  PLOT SUMMARY:I think any attempt at a plot summary is doomed to inadequacy, so let me just briefly frame the story. The novel follows the exploits of the fictional 256th fighter squadron, stationed on the fictional island of Pianosa, during the height of WWII. With a large cast of characters and a non-chronological narrative that switches viewpoints constantly, Heller creates a delicious cauldron of madness and bureaucratic ineptitude that is just heaven to follow. Our chief tour guide through the nuthouse is Captain John Yossarian, bomber pilot, whose main ambition in life is to “live forever or die in the attempt”. Yossarian’s life wish is so strong that he doesn’t even distinguish between the “enemy” and his superiors. As far as he&apos;s concerned, the enemy “is anybody who&apos;s going to get you killed, no matter which side he&apos;s on.” To avoid the final finality of death, Yossarian concocts a series of ingenious (and hysterical) methods for staying alive, including poisoning his own squadron and redrawing a the combat map during the “Great Big Siege of Bologna” so as to alter the bombing target. Despite his often less than moral shenanigans, Yossarian acts as the conscience of the story and helps to keep the rampant lunacy and chaos in context. His is the voice of indignity and righteous anger against the war and the cold, faceless bureaucracy that perpetrates it. Even against the God that allows it such horrors to exist in the first place. 
   ‘Don&apos;t tell me God works in mysterious ways,’ Yossarian continued, hurtling on over her objection. ‘There&apos;s nothing so mysterious about it. He&apos;s not working at all. He&apos;s playing. Or else He&apos;s forgotten all about us. That&apos;s the kind of God you people talk about - a country bumpkin, a clumsy, bungling, brainless, conceited, uncouth hayseed. Good God, how much reverence can you have for a Supreme Being who finds it necessary to include such phenomena as phlegm and tooth decay in His divine system of creation? What in the world was running through that warped, evil, scatological mind of His when He robbed old people of the power to control their bowel movements? Why in the world did He ever create pain?’ ‘Pain?’ Lieutenant Scheisskopf&apos;s wife pounced upon the word victoriously. ‘Pain is a useful symptom. Pain is a warning to us of bodily dangers.’‘And who created the dangers?’ Yossarian demanded ... ‘Why couldn&apos;t He have used a doorbell instead to notify us?’
THOUGHTS:Loved it, loved it, loved it, loved it, loved it, loved it, loved it, loved it, loved it, loved it…and loved it. The writing is brilliant, the characters are unique, engaging and memorable, and the story will scar you with wonder and awe. I can’t believe I hesitated so long to read this, and I intend to sit down with this many times in the years to come. For those that have experienced this before, and for those who just want a stroll down memory lane, here are a few pearls that showcase this novel’s rather large package of absurd, satircal win. **“Fortunately, just when things were blackest, the war broke out.”**&quot;I&apos;ll tell you what justice is. Justice is a knee in the gut from the floor on the chin at night sneaky with a knife brought up down on the magazine of a battleship sandbagged underhanded in the dark without a word of warning.&quot;**“Colonel Cargill could be relied on to run the most prosperous enterprise into the ground. He was a self-made man who owed his lack of success to nobody.”**“Colonel Cathcart was indefatigable that way, an industrious, intense, dedicated military tactician who calculated day and night in the service of himself.And a personal favorite (all leading up to the very last line):
  The chaplain had mastered, in a moment of divine intuition, the handy technique of protective rationalization, and he was exhilarated by his discovery. It was miraculous. It was almost no trick at all, he saw, to turn vice into virtue and slander into truth, impotence into abstinence, arrogance into humility, plunder into philanthropy, thievery into honor, blasphemy into wisdom, brutality into patriotism, and sadism into justice. Anybody could do it; it required no brains at all. It merely required no character.
 Finally, I wanted to share one last piece of awesome with you. The following is the contents of the letter sent by the base commander to the wife of one of the main characters. 
  Dear Mrs., Mr., Miss, or Mr. And Mrs. [no spoiler]: Words cannot express the deep personal grief I experienced when your husband, son, father, or brother was killed, wounded, or reported missing in action.
 Priceless…and what’s even funnier is that the set up of the joke occurs about 200 pages before. Masterful. 6.0 stars. HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!
         
        
      I love Catch 22! Its a classic, but it took me three tries to actually get into the book.
    
  
        
      Stephen, this is excellent!
    
  
        
      *grin*You totally nailed this one.

      Wow, is it really that awesome? I&apos;ve missed/resisted reading this my whole life. Ditto Slaughterhouse Five and Catcher in the Rye. Don&apos;t ask me what the mental block is, but it&apos;s definitely there. Okay, you&apos;ve made me reconsider. Now I&apos;m really curious :)

What in the world was running through that warped, evil, scatological mind of His when He robbed old people of the power to control their bowel movements?See, here is the proof of the logic &quot;get out of the way and let the story shine&quot; as regards reviews. You choose a few quotes that really nail the experience you had of the book. Put &apos;em in the review. Stand back and let the chips fall where they may.So, in conclusion, may I just reiterate: Nailed.
    
  
        
      Until I came to GoodReads, I never believed in channeling. You know. The ability to harness the personae of a dead spirit, then manifest that energy between the other world and our own.I could be wrong. But I think Stephen has been channeling Mark Twain in his reviews. No one can have that much writing talent on their own, right?
    
  
      I thought you didn’t believe in God. I don’t, she sobbed, bursting violently into tears. But the God I don’t believe in is a good God, a just God, a merciful God. He’s not the mean and stupid God you make him out to be.” Yossarian laughed and turned her arms loose. “Let’s have a little more religious freedom between us.’ he proposed obligingly. You don’t believe in the God you want to, and I won’t believe in the God I want to. Is that a deal?
    
  
      Major Major had been born too late and too mediocre. Some men are born mediocre, some men achieve mediocrity, and some men have mediocrity thrust upon them. With Major Major it had been all three. Even among men lacking all distinction he inevitably stood out as a man lacking more distinction then all the rest, and people who met him were always impressed with how unimpressive he was.
    
  
        
      This book never ceases to make me laugh on whatever page I open it up to.....Everyone must read this book.
    
  
        
      If you liked this book, check out its predecessor The Good Soldier Svejk by Jaroslav Hasek. Heller admits he drew a lot of his zanyness from this long, hilarious, and sadly unfinished novel.
    
  
        
      Marvelous review! I like the comparisons to other notable authors at the beginning. I wish I remembered more about this book, been a long time.
    
  
        
      time for a reread. thanks for the reminder
    
  
        
      Once again great review and great to have those handy quotes to entice me back for a re-read....sorry that almost makes you sound like you&apos;re pimping for Heller but you know what i mean
    
  
        
      Brilliant review for a brilliant book :)
    
  
        
      WOW! what a review!
    
  
        
      I couldn&apos;t get through this book back when I first tried, 16 months ago, and I didn&apos;t succeed the second timr either, but perhaps I&apos;ll give it a third try. Now that I&apos;ve read (and loved) Kurt Vonnegut, perhaps it&apos;ll be easier for me to get into it. And you do make it sound great. Fantastic review.
    
  
        
      I enjoyed it the first time I read it, but your review makes me want to go back and read it again to see if I like it even more this time around. Awesome review btw.
    
  
        
      Great review, Stephen! I picked up this book, somewhat reluctantly, a few years back. One of those &quot;I guess I should read this...&quot; books. Two hundred pages later, I realized I just couldn&apos;t put it down. And so I didn&apos;t.
    
  
        
      Great review for a great book, Stephen!

As far as classics go, I go into some with lowered expectations (Frankenstein, The Catcher in the Rye and 1984 all come to mind). These invariably have been the ones that knock me on my ass. This is another one of those. I hesitated to read it, didn&apos;t expect much, and got floored by it. BTW, if you listen to audiobooks, this one is performed, not just read, performed to perfection. I would highly recommend it.

      In my review I tried to communicate my discomfort for laughing at absurd and ironic descriptions of war contained in this book. I had the haunted feeling that comes from laughing at what at first appears to be funny, then to realize that it&apos;s actually a horrible tragic disaster for another person. I did appreciate to book&apos;s ending that contained a combination of emotion and questions regarding moral integrity which transcended the war story.
    
  
        
      Nice review, Clif. While I liked the book a whole lot more than you did, I thought you made some excellent points.

      Just finished reading it myself and thought it was fantastic! Great review Stephen.
    
  
        
      I read this about 30 years ago and absolutely loved it. I tried to re-read it about 10 years later and couldn&apos;t make it through. I don&apos;t know exactly what it was, but I remember thinking that I already knew all the jokes, and all I was left with was the pain of it all. I&apos;m not sure what I would think now.
    
  
        
      Thanks for the reminder to add this to my own faves-of-all-time list! I so love this book.
    
  
        
      You are very welcome, Kelly. An amazing book.
    
  
        
      Stephen, I&apos;m so glad you loved this novel! I really enjoyed it too :)
    
  
        
      Thanks, Anne. It was a terrific experience.
    
  
        
      Well done Smarty pants. I&apos;ve somehow ended up with two copies of this on my bookshelf and I&apos;m yet to read either!
    
  
        
      Thank you, good lady. I would read it quickly before your two copies get together and breed out of boredom and neglect. You could end up with a whole family of copies, and then where would you be?
    
  
        
      Great review Stephen, actually this one I have to re-read, I&apos;ve got a printed version but I also recently got it on my e-reader so my reminder is constantly with me...
    
  
        
      Thank you, Marts. I&apos;m glad you liked it. I hope you enjoy the re-read.
    
  
        
      Stephen do you remember which audio book version you listened to? My library had two versions. I checked out the one narrated by Jay O Sanders/Recorded Books.
    
  
        
      That is the one I listened to, Regina.
    
  
        
      Great review, ashamed to say not read the book but I will be now! Sooner rather than later hopefully.
    
  
        
      Your review makes want to read it
    
  
        
      I had the same experience as Duffy. I wasn&apos;t sure why, but I think she/he(?) provided a clue in saying she(?) felt like she&apos;d heard all the jokes before. Is the book so lacking in depth of characterisation that it is reduced to one long book of jokes? And jokes are rarely funny on a second hearing. I&apos;d be interested to see how you feel about it on re-reading it in five years time.Great review though, exactly how I felt about it the first time I read it.
    
  
        
      Thank you for this great review, I really liked it :)And I adored the book!

           Hmm, where to start with a book like this one. A book that is a third Kafka, a third Vonnegut, a third Pynchon and completely insane? For the first 200 or 250 pages, it is like a broken record or a movie loop with Sisyphus rolling that boulder up a hill in American WWII battle fatigues (and a flight suit and a Mae West life preserver sans the inflation module thanks the M&amp;M Enterprises). Then, when the flak starts flying and the blood is splattered everywhere it is intense right up until the end.It features Chaucerian cast of characters that would not be out of place in the German chaos of Gravity&apos;s Rainbow or The Tin Drum. A few examples:Major Major Major Major: &quot;He was a proud and independent man who was opposed to unemployment insurance and never hesitated to whine, whimper, wheedle, and extort for as much as he could get from whoever he could. He was a devout man whose pulpit was everywhere.&quot; But if you want a meeting with him, you&apos;ll have to wait until he has climbed out the window of his office and run down the gully.Colonel Cathart: &quot;a slick, successful, slipshod, unhappy man of thirty-six who lumbered while we walked and wanted to be a general...[he was] impervious to absolutes. He could measure his own progress only in relationship to others, and his idea of excellence was to do something at least as well as all the men his same age who were doing the same thing even better.&quot; Even if (or especially if) that meant raising the number of combat missions from 50 to 80 to impress General Peckham or General Dreedle or (gasp) General Scheisskopf (!!) whose wife was well, just a little promiscuous.Then there is the Anabaptist chaplain who started to wonder about whether God exists and is tortured by his assistant, the sadistic Colonel Whitcomb and spends a lot of time wondering whether everything he sees is déjà vu, presque vu or jamais vu.Also, the ill-fated young Nately and the equally ill-fated old man debating whether America was winning the war or whether Italy was since Italy has already survived more than two millennia more than the US even existed: &quot;This sordid, vulturous, diabolical old man reminded [him] of his father because the two were nothing at all alike.&quot;And then there is Yossarian, the protagonist. Perhaps the insane Captain (decorated for making a second bombing pass that killed Kraft) being the sanest person on the island of Pianosa despite being haunted by Snowden, the soldier in white, the dead man in his tent, persecuted and nearly killed by Nately&apos;s whore and all the death and absurdity around him. Yossarian is an everyman who is justifiably paranoid, but just a cog in the system and the only person that retains a sense of outrage at the senseless violence all around him.This is the most anti-war book I believe I have ever read. It makes M*A*S*H look like a US Army recruiting poster in comparison. I was horrified by one-man syndicate M&amp;M Enterprises of Milo Minderbender the cynic who deals with total impunity openly with both sides - even manning the anti-aircraft flak machines on the Italian coast shooting down US bombers and bombing his own squadron with loads of casualties. (This of course scarily parallels the Trump links with Putin and Russia and the massive amounts of money that Trump stands to make as POTUS.) Kid Simpson&apos;s slaughter was perhaps the most gruesome of them all, but the the scenes of terror and anarchy that Yossarian sees in Rome before being arrested for being there without a pass (leaving the murderous Aarfy smiling and careless as always) were chilling.Do not come here seeking logic or sanity because in war, neither has any place - not in Catch-22 and I suppose in real life either. It reminded me of a cab driver I had once in New Orleans (true story) who was bragging to me about burying Iraquis in their trenches by rolling over them with tanks and bulldozers during the first Gulf War. When I mentioned that it was against the Geneva Convention to bury men alive, he shrugged in the rearview mirror and said &quot;They told us that those rules didn&apos;t apply to us since this was just a conflict and not a war and besides, we were the US Army and not bound by some stupid European rules.&quot;If, as I did, you struggle through the first 200 pages, the pace picks up - as does the violence - and you will find yourself cheering for Yossarian and racing to the end (if not, as Yossarian, to Sweden.)I would give it 5 stars, but the first 200 pages are really torture to get through, so for lack of being able to give a 4.5, I rounded down to 4 stars. Regardless, I can clearly see, however, why this classic is held in such high esteem. May we never go through another war like this again. I can also see some of the inspiration for Alan Alda for creating M*A*S*H in the 70s and, reading Fire In the Lake about Vietnam, we learned absolutely nothing from the errors that Heller describes.Reading the second Rick Atkinson book of The Liberation Trilogy about the Allied campaign in Italy. Every bit as brutal and chaotic as Heller portrayed it - particularly the brutal inch-by-inch campaign up from Salerno to Rome! Anzio was particularly horrendous. Curious fact: Roger Waters&apos; father (the one he eulogizes in The Wall) died at Anzio.Highly recommended as a piece of essential anti-war black humor.
         
        
      One of the best books I&apos;ve ever read.
    
  
        
      Oh i love this book
    
  
        
      It is NOT easy to continue though. i know that is the whole point but it does feel like a sisyphusian effort sometimes

      The current Bologna thing and the crazy Hungry Joe are freaking hilarious. Just slow reading is all. I mean I average 60-100 pages an hour normally but with C22, I am lucky to get 20-40 pages done in that time
    
  
        
      &quot;This sordid, vulturous, diabolical old man reminded [him] of his father because the two were nothing at all alike.&quot; thanks for that.
    
  
        
      No problem dianne. That line really stuck our for me.
    
  
        
      Thanks for reminding me what a breathtaking book this is. I read it way back, remembered it as savagely anti-war, but had forgotten the story itself. And what a shocking encounter in your New Orleans cab!
    
  
        
      Thanls Lyn. I heard similar stories from others - including a childhood friend that served there- but that one was the most brutal and shocking.
    
  
        
      great review
    
  
        
      Thanks Mebarka!
    
  
        
      Excellent review, Le_fino! I&apos;m planning to read this in 2017. Thanks. L.
    
  
        
      Uw Lizzy! And thanks for the compliment!
    
  
        
      Hello le_fino, nice review! Just two things, so do you mean to say that this book reads like a mixture of Kafka, Vonnegut and Pynchon? Inside my copy of Infinite Jest there is a quote by S. King saying the two greatest novels of this century are Catch-22 and IJ. Which got me thinking I should read Catch-22 next year until I read your first post!
    
  
        
      I want to read this, but the parallels to current America are almost too chilling.
    
  
        
      If I had had that taxi driver, I would probably have ended up with a black eye or worse as I know I would not have been able to keep my mouth shut.
    
  
        
      I&apos;m at page 710 of IJ and I&apos;m not looking forward to the end, despite the dark stuff and the sadness, I really love reading DFW and getting pleasantly lost in all his rabbit holes. You were right about wanting to go back and reading the first quarter of the book, once you can gauge the tone of his narrative you all of a sudden sense that you may have missed the essence of what goes on at the beginning (I hope that makes sense!)
    
  
        
      @Manybooks, yes there are a lot of frightening parallels between Trump&apos;s mafia and Russian connections and Milo Minderbender&apos;s Syndicate
    
  
        
      @Rodrigo Not sure if I am going with S King&apos;s choices (Light in August and For Whom the Bell Tolls are arguable superior to IJ and C-22). I meant Kafka for the descriptions of administrative absurdity, Vonnegut for use of absurd, humoristic American language and diction and Pynchon for the variety of characters and descriptions of anarchy and chaos.
    
  
        
      That doesn&apos;t mean I don&apos;t love IJ btw
    
  
        
      Undoubtedly one of those books that gave me my relentless bad attitude about THE ESTABLISHMENT - to hark back to a sixties term. Maybe it was THE book
    
  
        
      I can see that. The Autobiography of Malcolm X, the christian freakout at The Last Temptation of Christ, Soledad Brother, and The Damned of the Earth did it for me :)
    
  
        
      Wow, thanks for the warning not to give up on first 200 pages. This is on my list to read in 2017- I&apos;m a bit nervous about it now
    
  
        
      It is worth it. Think of it as a marathon and pace yourself:)
    
  
        
      Congrats le_fino! I&apos;m very encouraged by your review! I will go back to listening when I&apos;m done with Swan Song!
    
  
        
      Cool!! Enjoy it Libby. How is Swan Song?

      The book by Kazantzakis is FAR better than the movie and prevented the author from being given an Orthodox burial. I&apos;d call it a must read actually and better than Satanic Verses. I love the epitaph on Kazantzakis grave: &quot;I hope for nothing. I fear nothing. I am free.&quot;

      Yeah, movie was bland. Book was a masterpiece and far more interesting and controversial than the film. Interesting thing is that a lot of his other books were quite orthodox. If I recall the Gospel of Mark&apos;s take on the Jesus myth was a man-god and what Kazantzakis was demonstrating that the man side could have had fantasies about sex without actually having sex. Apparently, the fanatics in both the Eastern and Western Christian worlds could not bear the thought of a lustful Jesus. Such repression of course has led to generations of pedophilia by priests. And so it goes. We never learn. Another Catch-22 really...
    
  
        
      Haha. Totally! Swan Song is great!
    
  
        
      Swan song by Chekov or perhaps I am misunderstanding you Libby?
    
  
        
      My local book club read it - again - this year ... and many had similar things to say
    
  
        
      It is a great book - once you get into it :)
    
  
        
      A super book - and even better on a re read
    
  
        
      Still means civilian deaths and summary executions. Given the actions of Drumpf and the Republicrats over the last week, it is really hard to give him any benefit but rather boosts the doubts concerning basic rights under a Drumpf administration and this scares me shitless
    
  
        
      Haha no le_fino Swan Song by McCammon and it was fantastic! But instead of going back to Catch 22 I jumped to Invisible Man by Ellison which is super great!
    
  
        
      OMG yes!! Reviewed ut here on GR! A wonderful book indeed! Lived it!
    
  
        
      No, Woo, we are not. Completely quiet here in fact. I see a few beggars on the street but they are mostly hopeless drunks, no Syrians wielding knives or guns.Stay skeptical - they are bullshitting you
    
  
        
      Scary thing for me about Drumpf foreign policy is is complete ignorance of global realpolitik issues like Ataiwan/China, he s ludicrous wall will Mexico (look how well that worked out for China! They had Mongol emperors for millenia, his nefarious ties with Moscow and organized crime, his conflicts of interest with various companies he owns or had parts of, his nepotism of putting psychotic, inexperienced relatives into key positions (like Napolean did with Spain, Naples and nearly every other European throne he conquered (and that worked ut exceedingly well in each case (well, the Napoleon relative got filthy rich in any case)...need I continue?
    
  
        
      For a modern, timely reprise of this theme, I highly recommend just published The Girl in Green. You won&apos;t have any problem with the speed of it. It&apos;s unputdownable. And funny.
    
  
        
      Thanks for the suggestion Betsy! Added to my tbr list!
    
  
        
      What an awesome review. It reminds me of everything I loved about this book, and why it&apos;s assigned reading in my kids&apos; high school.
    
  
        
      :)
    
  
        
      I loved this book and, coincidentally, found myself struggling to explain it to my two girls (somebody (mis)used the phrase &apos;Catch 22&apos; in conversation)..Nice review - It&apos;s made me want to read it again
    
  
        
      Thanks Ann. It is amazing how this innocuous phrase entered into the ever-evolving fabric of the English language. I get the word &quot;Catch&quot; but the number &quot;22&quot; gives it a sort of ambiguous institutional feel. Amazing.
    
  
        
      Good review! Personally, though, I loved the early part of the book for its sense of humor.
    
  
        
      I love the first 200 pages. I love all the pages. I love this book. One of my all-time favorites, without a doubt. Major Major Major Major is probably my favorite character name of any book. Arbitrary promotions based on extrinsic qualities are a major part of life, and poor Major Major Major Major is the epitome of such an instance.
    
  
        
      Agreed! Thanks Abram Abram Abram Abram ;)
    
  
        
      @Abram Its funny because my dad and I have COMPLETELY different tastes in reading (he is more of a Tom Clancy-Dan Brown kind of reader whereas, well, I am not), but we both loved Catch-22 and his favourite character is also Major Major Major Major!

           The following is an example of how many conversations in this book took place.Jen: I didn&apos;t like this book.Nigel: Why didn&apos;t you like the book?Jen: I did like the book.Nigel: You just said you didn&apos;t like the book.Jen: No I didn&apos;t.Nigel: You&apos;re lying.Jen: I don&apos;t believe in lying.Nigel: So you never lie?Jen: Oh yes, I lie all the time.Nigel: You just said you don&apos;t believe in it.Jen: I don&apos;t believe in it, Jen said as she ate a chocolate covered cotton ball.Nigel: Well I liked the book.Jen: Fabulous! I liked it too!Nigel: What did you like about it?Jen: Oh, I hated it.I think Heller was showing how war is chaotic by not writing in a chronological order. You really have no idea in what order events are taking place. I think he was showing how war is ridiculous by writing conversations like the one above. I&apos;m not sure if any of his goals were to annoy the living hell out of his readers, but he annoyed me. 460 pages of absurdness is too much for me. Most of the characters were very one-dimensional. I could only distinguish between people by their names. Most of the good guys all had the same personalities and the bad guys all had the same personalities except one character ate peanut brittle and another put crab apples in his cheeks. Other than that - same personalities. Maybe his goal was only to distinguish between the good, everyday guys and the evil, power-hungry men in charge. If so, he succeeded. I just wasn&apos;t thrilled after page 150 or so. There is some funny stuff in there. The chocolate-covered cotton balls will crack me up for life. There&apos;s some really sad stuff too. It&apos;s weird because every time someone died, I cared, even though I knew nothing about them, except what they ate or who their favorite whore was. I&apos;m not sure how Heller pulled that off. Anyway, I would recommend it. It&apos;s just that the ridiculousness of it gets to the point where it&apos;s just, well, ridiculous, and beyond my personal tolerance level. I still appreciated it though.
         
        
      I love your conversation, it&apos;s absolutely terrible.
    
  
        
      @up: exactly ;)
    
  
        
      who is Nigel?!
    
  
        
      incredibly confusing you get lost by the first couple sentences
    
  
        
      &quot;There&apos;s some really sad stuff too. It&apos;s weird because every time someone died, I cared, even though I knew nothing about them, except what they ate or who their favorite whore was. I&apos;m not sure how Heller pulled that off&quot; Exactly!For all the rest, I felt the same way about the book. Some parts were funny, though and I had to laugh out loud.
    
  
        
      This was amazing, Jennifer :) Spot on!
    
  
        
      I have just waded through this book :( too many conversations like that. I&apos;m so glad it&apos;s over. What was the story again?!
    
  
        
      This completely sums up my feelings on this novel. I can see why people call it a classic, but it wasn&apos;t up my alley and had exactly this kind of logic.
    
  
        
      Pretty much spot on in regard to my feelings and thoughts on this book.
    
  
        
      Most balanced review I&apos;ve found so far. I&apos;ve read the book once and I&apos;m rereading but I can barely get through it this time. It seems because of the sheer repeatedness of plot lines and the funny crazy but albeit one dimensional characters
    
  
        
      I think you are reading it the wrong way. It is not meant as a traditional fiction. It didn&apos;t pay much attention to plot advance, personality development etc. It is meant as a satire, which it delivered brilliantly, IMHO
    
  
        
      your review is spot on, and exactly how i also felt about this book
    
  
        
      Yes, this. I agree completely.
    
  
        
      Well, I think I am going to pick a new book to read. lol
    
  
        
      Well, there&apos;s one book I&apos;m not going to try after all. Far too deep!!Thanks guys, (Jennifer in particular)
    
  
        
      Perfect review! I&apos;m still attempting to finish this one but all the characters definitely seem to be the same
    
  
        
      Perfect review. Thank you! I thought there was something wrong with me for feeling this way after many people recommended the book. I am still glad I read it :-)
    
  
        
      I am reading it and you just put into words my exact feelings towards this book. I am always wondering what makes me keep reading it and I also do not know whether I can power myself through. haha
    
  
        
      YES. You are spot on. I cared a lot when a character died, but up until that point it was difficult to read. YET I would also recommend it hahahahaha.
    
  
        
      I tried so hard to read it but the conversations were just going nowhere. Your example was so perfect.
    
  
        
      Haha that conversation 😂
    
  
        
      Much agreed. This book made me laugh at loud on multiple occasions, but the characters were all the same.
    
  
        
      Your review cracked me up! I’m only on page 73 and can’t take the talking in circles anymore but I don’t want to give up but I don’t want to go on either!!!!
    
  
        
      it being beyond your tolerance level is kind of the point of the book!

           I have had Catch-22 on my bookshelf for years. It was one of those novels that I&apos;ve said, &quot;oh I&apos;ll get around to that in 2012&quot;. It didn&apos;t happen. &quot;Maybe 2013&quot;. Nope. And so on until just a couple of days ago. I&apos;ve got to stop putting books off. Rarely has a piece of literature ticked so many of my boxes. Satire, farce, gallows humour, irreverence, it&apos;s as if this book were written entirely for me. I loved every word on every page of this book. I cannot find a single miniscule fault anywhere within the narrative or the prose or the characterisation or the flow or the humour. I can say without any hesitation that Catch-22 is a perfect novel. It was love at first sight.
         
        
      Looking forward to your review on this one!
    
  
        
      Barry, the year is a little more than halfway over and you&apos;ve already given 2 books five stars. You&apos;re mellowing in your old age.
    
  
        
      Barry Pierce, to me, it remains one of the best &apos;Black Comedy&apos; novels I have read.
    
  
        
      So glad you liked this!
    
  
        
      I agree and felt exactly like you right after I read it!
    
  
        
      Say &quot;perfect&quot;- that&apos;s my word too! Yep loved every word on every page, I feel exactly the same!
    
  
        
      In complete agreement Barry. Due to space, I have to be very picky about which books remain on our book shelves after reading. Catch-22 has earned it&apos;s place there!
    
  
        
      Finally found a review that does not mention how the reviewer suffered through it.. it is a gem... I&apos;m going through it the second time... It&apos;s just perfect!

           Catch-22, Joseph HellerCatch-22 is a satirical novel by American author Joseph Heller. He began writing it in 1953; the novel was first published in 1961. Often cited as one of the most significant novels of the twentieth century, it uses a distinctive non-chronological third-person omniscient narration, describing events from the points of view of different characters. The separate storylines are out of sequence so the timeline develops along with the plot.عنوانها: کلک مرغابی؛ تبصره 22؛ نویسنده: جوزف هلر؛ تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز سیزدهم ماه آگوست سال 2001 میلادیعنوان: کلک مرغابی؛ نویسنده: جوزف هلر؛ مترجم: کامبیز پاک فر؛ تهران، مرجان، 1378؛ دو جلد در یک مجلد؛ در 806 ص؛ شابک: 9649049304؛ موضوع: جنگ جهانی دوم قرن 20 معنوان: تبصره 22؛ نویسنده: جوزف هلر؛ مترجم: حسن افشار؛ تهران، ماهی، 1393؛ در 552 ص؛ شابک: 9789642092000؛ عنوان: تبصره 22؛ نویسنده: جوزف هلر؛ مترجم: احسان نوروزی؛ تهران، چشمه، 1394؛ در 518 ص؛ شابک: 9786002295613؛اونا می‌خوان منو بکشن.؛هیچ‌کس نمی‌خواد تو رو بکشه.؛پس چرا به طرفم تیراندازی می‌کنن؟اونا می‌خوان همه رو بکشن.؛خب چه فرقی می‌کنه؟پیدا کردن تکه ای که بتواند گوشه‌ ای از منطق رمان «تبصره 22» باشد، کار ناممکن یا دشواری ست، شاید گفتگوی بالا نزدیک‌ترین بخش داستان به این انتظار باشد. «یوسارین»، افسر نیروی هوایی آمریکا، تصمیم گرفته، دیگر جانش را به خطر نیندازد، و پرواز نکند، چون احساس می‌کند ضدهوایی‌های دشمن قصد دارند او را بکشند. اما همکارش اینگونه نمی‌اندیشد، چون باور دارد سربازان دشمن قصد دارند همه را بکشند. این درست همان‌جایی است، که کشمکش اصلی داستان «تبصره 22» شکل می‌گیرد. «یوسارین» دیگر به جنگ، به چشم یک رخداد اجتماعی نگاه نمی‌کند، بلکه جنگ برای او مسئله‌ ای کاملا فردی است.؛ طبعا اگر همه آدم‌های متخاصم در دو طرف یک جنگ، می‌توانستند مثل «یوسارین» جنگ را فردی ببینند، هیچ جنگی آن‌قدرها پا نمی‌گرفت؛ و به کشتار نمیانجامید. ذات جنگ، اساسا بر ایده ی گذشتن از فرد، و قرار گرفتن در خدمت یک اجتماع، یا یک ایده و باور، استوار است. ترفند اصلی «جوزف هلر»، نگارنده، برای زیر پرسش بردن برهان جنگ، همان بازگشت به فردیت کسانی است، که قرار است سربازان جنگ باشند. مسئله باورهای فردی، در برابر اجتماع جنگ‌جو، نقطه مرکزی رمان «هلر» است، که در همه جای رمان جاری شده، و به فرم آن نیز نشت کرده است. فرمی که منتقدان بسیاری، این نگارش را نپسندیده اند. اما این نیز هست که رمان «تبصره‌‌ ی 22» اثر «جوزف هلر» را، به همراه «برهنه‌ ها و مرده‌ ها» اثر: «نورمن میلر»، و «سلاخ‌ خانه‌ ی شماره پنج» اثر: «کورت ونه‌ گات»؛ یکی از سه اثر ادبیات ضدجنگ آمریکا بنوشته اند. نویسندگان هر سه رمان، به نوعی در رخدادهای جنگ جهانگیر دوم، شرکت داشته‌، و جنگ را از نزدیک تجربه کرده‌ اند. «جوزف هِلـِر» که فرزند خانواده‌ ای مهاجر، از یهودیان روس‌ تبار بودند، در سال 1942 میلادی در سن نوزده سالگی، به ارتش آمریکا پیوستند، و در سال‌های پایانی جنگ، به عنوان بمب‌ انداز هواپیماهای بی‌.52 در شصت ماموریت جنگی شرکت کردند (در هواپیماهای آن دوره: خلبانی، ناوبری و مسیریابی، و هدف‌یابی برای انداختن بمب؛ هر یک مسئول جداگانه‌ داشت)؛ ا. شربیانی

      Wow! This is a Persian translation of Catch 22. Iran is a country which is more cultured and educated than Saudi Arabia. I am sure few books from the English speaking world gets translated in Arabic and become published originally from Saudi Arabia.
    
  
        
      I guess someone has to say it – on my first read I imagined Shamim E. Haque is expressing a vulgar version of Farsi patriotism till I realized Shamim is not Farsi speaking. On a following note I do envy many works of world literature available in Arabic mainly via Egypt but lacking in Farsi.

           &quot;Insanity is contagious.&quot; Like so many other works of originally absurd or dystopian character, this classic catches up with reality faster than I can process. When I first shared Yossarian&apos;s frustration over the perfect catch, I did so in a quite abstract way, enjoying the intellectual game the novel kept me engaged in. Now I find myself frequently thinking of his pain as something I experience myself, every day, reading news and listening to the authorities that are in charge to rule the world. If you want to succeed against the insanity of populist ruthlessness and to restore liberal values and democratic processes, you have to adopt the insane leaders&apos; weapons, and turn yourself into a demagogue playing to the stupidity and insanity of the indoctrinated, thoughtless masses. But then, of course, you do not represent liberal values and democratic processes anymore, you turn into the monster you fight.When Yossarian realised that he could only escape the threat to his life (the active participation in the war) if he was declared insane, and that expressing the wish to escape the threat to his life showed he was in fact sane, he knew he was in the clutches of insane authorities (which ironically therefore were safe from dying in the war for which they were responsible!). They were keeping their numbing power over him as long as he was sane enough to resist, and human enough to have a character:&quot;It was miraculous. It was almost no trick at all, he saw, to turn vice into virtue and slander into truth, impotence into abstinence, arrogance into humility, plunder into philanthropy, thievery into honor, blasphemy into wisdom, brutality into patriotism, and sadism into justice. Anybody could do it; it required no brains at all. It merely required no character.&quot;As a novel showing the absurdity of war and of nationalism on an individual level, while keeping a (bittersweet) sense of humour, this labyrinth of a tale has no peer:&quot;The country was in peril; he was jeopardizing his traditional rights of freedom and independence by daring to exercise them.&quot;So here is my catch, let&apos;s call it the catch 42 - the catch that kicks in whenever we try to find the Answer to Life, The Universe and Everything. If all insane leaders of the world read this book, they would understand the meaninglessness of their destructive power play, and they would change their ways and the world would finally be a safe place. The catch is that they have to be sane to read it.So, read it if you are sane enough to understand it. It will drive you crazy though.
         
        
      Super Review, Lisa! Nur, in der Bewertung mag ich dir leider nicht mehr zustimmen. Habe das Buch vor zwei oder drei Jahren noch einmal (an)gelesen und fand es längst nicht mehr so skurril und anarchisch wie bei der Erstlektüre. Neben wirklich witzige Ideen gibt es auch viel Klamauk und Durststrecken, fand ich.Eine Idee allerdings spricht mich bis heute an: Yossarian ist der Überzeugung, dass der Krieg nur geführt wird, um ihn abzuschießen. Das klingt so absolut paranoid, dass ich früher darüber gelacht habe. Aber eigentlich ist genau das das Wesen des Krieges: dass Menschen gezielt getötet werden. Und da wir vor allem Absoluten, vor allem aber vor dem Tod für uns alleine stehen, wäre Yossarians &quot;Paranoia&quot;, wenn sie nur jeder Teilen wollte, vermutlich das beste Heilmittel gegen Kriege.
    
  
        
      Mich hat deine Review neugierig gemacht und ich will diesen modernen Klassiker endlich mal lesen.

Es geht in etwa so: &quot;Die Tatsache, dass man Paranoia hat, bedeutet nicht, dass sie nicht hinter einem her sind.&quot; Yossarian hat wirklich Recht, von seinem individuellen Standpunkt aus. Und welchen anderen Standpunkt könnte er annehmen, sobald er Ideologie und Nationalismus als Sterbensgründe ablehnt? Im Grunde erklärt er jede Diktatur (politisch oder religiös) für bankrott, und jeder Märtyrer ist verrückt, im klinischen Sinn. Ich bin deiner Meinung, dass es auf und ab geht in der Geschichte, habe das aber aus zwei Gründen gerne in Kauf genommen:1. Krieg ist auch oft sinnlos langweilig und absurd, das reine Gegenteil von Spannung und Stringenz.2. Die allgemeine Aussage des Buches hat mich gepackt und nie wieder losgelassen. Es ist eines jener Bücher, an die ich immer und immer wieder zurückdenke.

      Great review.
    
  
        
      I agree that they have to be sane to read it, Lisa. I also think they have to be able to read. I realize that this review is at least a few years old, but it seems even more apt today than when you reviewed it in 2014. You and Heller have both presaged a great deal of modern truths. Even in 2014 you were &quot;raging against the machine&quot;. If I may say, in following your reviews in the last few years, you haven&apos;t lost any of your passion for good. Thanks be to that -- and thanks for this timely reminder of what needs to be done.

When I first added and reviewed this book, years ago, my reading went completely unnoticed on GR as it took me over two years until I dared to reach out and share my rage against the machine with other readers. Heller was both a historian and a prophet - or just simply a sensitive soul who saw what others refused to see. And yes, in the years since I first read his masterpiece, insanity and illiteracy have unfortunately developed in a direction that makes catch 22:s all the more likely for those who still dare to be sane - and literate.

You&apos;ve become the voice in my head now that rails against injustice and prejudice : I look forward to the daily Lisa review, and miss them when they are absent for a day or two. Heller: a bolt of lightning and an inspiration: he awakened us all. Hard to imagine that C22 was decried when it first appeared. It takes time, and the world turning a few more times, before genius is recognized.
    
  
        
      You have captured this insane feedback loop perfectly, and your points about current leadership &amp; populism are spot on - it is absolutely maddening.
    
  
        
      Thought provoking review. Whilst written 50 years and more ago this wonderful book still resonates. Funny, sad and wise.One follow up idea perhaps. Have you read The Good Soldier Svejk? Heller namechecked it as part of the inspiration for catch 22
    
  
        
      Fabulous review, Lisa! Luckily, I read this when I was young enough to be passionate about it while remaining sane - or, maybe just young enough to re-gain sanity afterward. :)

           I originally read this about 15 years ago. When I joined Goodreads and added the books I had previously read I remembered it as a 3 star book. I am not sure if it is being 15 years older or the fact that I did the audiobook this time, but it was easily 5 stars now!The first thing that came to mind after I was a few chapters into this was the show “Seinfeld”. Always touted as a show about nothing, this book was kind of about nothing. It is series of smaller anecdotes, usually somewhat silly, that really don’t have a specific function in moving the plot. It is a satire about war, red tape, chain of command, etc. and the inherent futility involved. While war and the tragedy that goes with it are usually not considered amusing, this feels like a therapeutic, tongue-in-cheek poke that needed to be made to maintain sanity.There are a plethora of characters – some of which are more caricatures – that may get your head spinning at first. Luckily, Heller gives them all memorable names which helps keep them organized easily. Maybe that was not his intention, but when you need to remember if it was Milo Minderbender or Major Major Major Major (yes, that is his name – my spell check did not like me repeating a word four times!) who did something, the reader is definitely given naming tools to keep them connected!I mentioned that there is not necessarily an overall story, but there are definitely themes. One is doing what is best for you no matter who gets stepped on in the process. Another is twisting the facts to make sure the ultimate outcome is what works best for you. And, of course, the BIG idea that has become a common colloquialism (I know I use it just about every day) is the situation of Catch-22. Early in the book, the first example of Catch-22 is that if you say you want to fly bombing missions, you must be crazy so they will take you off the missions – only someone crazy would want to fly missions. But, if you are not on the missions, your sanity is no longer in question so they will make you fly them. If you say you don’t want to fly them, you are sane so you will have to fly them. Basically, no matter how you feel about flying missions, you will end up flying them anyway! Situations like this are repeated throughout the book where there is no good answer to the situation at hand – often with hilarious and frustrating results.Now, I mention that the book is humorous satire, but it does have many dark moments as well. This kind of goes back to my mention of the discourse within the novel being therapeutic. War is crazy and what can happen is brutal. Oddly enough, a Jimmy Buffett quote from Changes in Latitudes, Changes in Attitudes comes to mind: “If we weren&apos;t all crazy we would go insane.” That pretty much sums up the book in a nutshell!So, should you read this book? Well, I think that question is a Catch-22 in itself. I think about 50% of the people who try this will hate it or dnf it. I think the other 50% of the people who read it will love it, quote it, put it on their favorites list. Where the Catch-22 is that I think any person has the capability to be in either category depending on where their mindset is right now. If I recommend it to you now you may hate me, or you may thank me profusely. In 10 years is would be visa versa! I do think the audiobook helped me appreciate it more and it is now in my favorites. Will that happen for you? I definitely cannot be the one to decide that!
         
        
      It&apos;s always interesting to me, and not a little jarring, when my opinions on books shift over time! Great review!
    
  
        
      I remember hearing Jamie Farr’s voice reading this to me.
    
  
        
      Another great review, Matthew. I don’t know why but I have always been a bit scared of this one. Maybe one day.

I was not very excited to go back and revisit this one. It ended up being a selection for one of my book clubs, so I figured a reread wouldn&apos;t hurt. Boy am I glad I did!

      I think I read this about 35 years ago. I remember it having a big impact back then. So glad that you got the opportunity to revisit a classic. 😁

      My husband loved this book, I just couldn&apos;t fall into step with it at all. Even so, it did not preclude me from thoroughly enjoying your review.

      Great review! I liked this book very much, although I skimmed the last 1/3 of it. I felt like I got the satirical point of it early on and was just done with it at the 60% mark. Too much of a good thing, you know? It’s the same reason I continue to rate The Hitchhiker&apos;s Guide to the Galaxy as a 2-3 star book every time I re-read it. I love satire and hyperbole, but I don’t want to be constantly beaten with it. Sigh, the struggles of a heavy reader....

           I’m not sure if it’s a talent or an affliction, but I’ve been blessed or cursed with a penchant for taking someone else’s creative work and extrapolating it to skewed extremes. That explains my yet-to-be-published collection of fan fiction, unauthorized sequels, and twists in perspective. I first discovered this talent/affliction as a boy when I imagined a fourth little pig who leveraged himself to the hilt, built a luxury skyscraper, and, with YUGE block letters at its base, labelled it Pig Tower. The Big Bad Wolf, as a professional courtesy (and quite possibly with the promise of kickbacks), agreed to a huff and puff waiver. As a teen I wrote a follow-up to Kurt Vonnegut’s classic that I called Slaughterhouse-Six. It was set in a mirror image world where war was devastating the planet Tralfamadore. Fortunately, the protagonist, Libby Mirglip, survived the bombs and lived a varied if not full life after the conflict. She was aided by alien visitors from planet Earth who showed her, through their own less enlightened example, what not to do. I’d prefer not to go into the details of one my more recent works, Fifty-two Shades of Grey. If it’s ever published, it’ll be under an assumed name, or maybe names – I’m toying with the idea of S. and M. John. BTW, I saw that some other joker stole my basic idea and technically beat me to the preferred number fifty-one.This brings us to my latest, Catch-23. Since I’ve already done an absurdist post-war account of tragedy/comedy with Slaughterhouse-Six, I wanted to steer clear of such a heavy/humorous theme this time. Instead, Catch-23 is the story of a local seafood restaurant on 23 S. Washington St. in Naperton, Illinois. They became famous for their Shrimp Yossarian. Then a new executive chef upped the number of times customers would fly through the doors by offering Skate Wing Schnitzel a la Scheisskopf, Major Major Mahi Mahi, and Stuffed Oysters Orr-style. Naperton’s whore gave the story some much needed spice. (As with any fan fiction, references will only be appreciated by those who know the original.)Oh, and hey, there is a catch here. Against your better judgment, you continued reading each ridiculous example in this exercise of “one more.&quot; Making it this far means you’ve read “one more” paragraph all the way to the end. The catch is that you must be crazy enough to perceive this as a payoff.

      If you do a kickstarter project, maybe we will kick you (just point to the appropriate portion of your anatomy) into publishing these stories. I&apos;m sure the list is longer than these few examples of your work.Alternatively you can open a restaurant and serve a different cuisine every week. Those stuffed oysters sound delicious.
    
  
        
      Haha, it seems like your literal interpretation of kickstarter would be a pretty effective way to spur some action. And you&apos;re right about those stuffed oysters. Even though they&apos;re fictional, they&apos;re really good!
    
  
        
      You&apos;re so young I&apos;m not sure I can take you seriously anymore, David. (But then you may have learned to do the same with me some time ago.)

      Steve, you had at the first paragraph. I could have given that paragraph five stars. I&apos;ll stop there and you can guess what my next thoughts were. P.S. You might want to think of one of those aliases to use soon. We don&apos;t know how long GR will remain uncensored.

Scholars have argued that these spin-offs/rip-offs have been happening since the Paleolithic. In fact, I saw one paper that said the first and only original account focusing on the absurdities of war was Zog Laugh in Fight With Bad Tribe (and At Self).

      I was 20 at the time, Susan. As for the dictionary, mine was easier to get to than the one you had to consult. :-) But the work you had to do in getting to it reinforced the meaning, if you know what I mean.

      I read this many years ago when I was in college. I&apos;ll have to reread it. I loved it then and I&apos;m curious what my take will be today.Shortly after I read Catch 22, I attended a reading by Joseph Heller where he read excerpts from Something Happened, which hadn&apos;t been published yet. Heller seemed to find that what he was reading was hilarious, but I found it unfunny.I probably should also read Something to see if my opinion of that has changed after all these years.
    
  
        
      This strikes me as quite a coincidence, Paul, since I made an almost identical comment about A Confederacy of Dunces in replying to you. I have only the vaguest of recollections about Something Happened. In fact, I couldn&apos;t even tell you if something did indeed happen.Thanks for commenting again here!

           *Trigger Warning: This review contains strong themes, to include rape.*Before I begin what will likely become a very long rant/public service announcement, let me first say a few words. I have nothing against E.L. James. Nothing. She’s said that this series is a fantasy she managed to put on paper and that she never expected it to gain such momentum. Good for her for perusing her dream of writing. If this book also fulfills one of your fantasies, or if you just plain enjoyed it, good for you too. This review is in no way meant to belittle or condemn you for liking these books, and nor is it an attack on the author. These are solely MY OPINIONS about how dangerous FSoG is to society and specifically to women. Needless to say, this book does not fulfill one of my fantasies. It’s pretty much my biggest nightmare.“But it’s just fiction!”No. You can’t use that argument with me. Not anymore. This book is not “just fiction”. This book has become a frigging phenomenon. As I write this, over 70 million copies have been sold in the United States alone, hardware stores have run out of “natural fiber” rope and there are even ‘BDSM for Beginners’ classes cropping up in small town America.So excuse me, but I can’t just read this and think of it like a fantasy, not when it’s become a reality for so many people, and not when I was so enraged by what I found within it.Okay everyone, take a deep breath, grab a cup of coffee or a glass of wine and settle in. We’re going to be here for a while. First up is probably the most inflammatory of the statements I’m going to make, so we might as well rip the band aid off.THIS BOOK PERPETUATES THE RAPE CULTURE WE WERE ALL RAISED IN.There, I’ve said it. I’m not taking it back and I’m not apologizing. If you’re unfamiliar with this phrase, allow me to elaborate. Wikipedia defines rape culture as:“A term used within women&apos;s studies and feminism, describing a culture in which rape and other sexual violence (usually against women) are common and in which prevalent attitudes, norms, practices, and media condone, normalize, excuse, or encourage sexualized violence.”Let’s look at the first half of that definition. As much as we may want to ignore the facts, rape and sexual violence are common in America. According to RAINN, the nation’s largest anti-sexual violence organization, someone in the U.S. is sexually assaulted every 2 minutes. On average that’s about 207,754 sexual assaults each year. 54% of sexual assaults are not reported, 97% of rapists will never spend a day in jail and 2/3 of these assaults are committed by someone known to the victim.I could go on for days about how prevalent attitudes, practices, and the media condone sexual violence, but I won’t because I’m really going to try and keep my words and links relevant to FSoG. Thankfully, throughout my research, I found several…hundred.The University of California has an interesting article about how social and cultural norms perpetuate rape and rape culture. In it, they specifically address how women are conditioned from early ages to be passive and accept and affect certain attitudes and behaviors. Here are some of the social rules they list and elaborate on:1. When spoken to, a woman must acknowledge the other person with a gracious smile.2. Women must answer questions asked of them.3. Women must not bother other people or make a scene because they are uncomfortable.4. When in trouble, it is best to defer to the protection and judgment of men.5. Casual touching or suggestive comments in social settings are meant as a tribute to a woman’s desirability.6. It is the natural state of affairs for men to carry the financial burden of social situations.7. When engaged in a social encounter, it is not proper for a woman to superior in any game, sport or discussion if she wants to be accepted.8. Women should always accept and trust the kindness of strangers if they offer help.There’s a blog post by Harriet Jacobs that also speaks to this and I urge you to read it in its entirety. In short, it says “…women are raised being told by parents, teachers, media, peers, and all surrounding social strata that:· it is not okay to set solid and distinct boundaries and reinforce them immediately and dramatically when crossed (“mean bitch”)· it is not okay to appear distraught or emotional (“crazy bitch”)· it is not okay to make personal decisions that the adults or other peers in your life do not agree with, and it is not okay to refuse to explain those decisions to others (“stuck-up bitch”)· it is not okay to refuse to agree with somebody, over and over and over again (“angry bitch”)· it is not okay to have (or express) conflicted, fluid, or experimental feelings about yourself, your body, your sexuality, your desires, and your needs (“bitch got daddy issues”)· it is not okay to use your physical strength (if you have it) to set physical boundaries (“dyke bitch”)· it is not okay to raise your voice (“shrill bitch”)· it is not okay to completely and utterly shut down somebody who obviously likes you (“mean dyke/frigid bitch”)Now how do these two examples relate to FSoG? Simply put, Ana, the main character in this series, continuously exhibits the behaviors listed in the rules and seems to have the mentality of those listed in the bullets. She might as well be the case study on which both were based.Early in the book there’s an interaction between her and a young man named Paul, the son of the couple she works for. This is someone she says has “always been a buddy”. Just after they greet each other with a hug, “he releases me but keeps a possessive arm draped over my shoulder. I shuffle from foot to foot, embarrassed. It’s good to see Paul, but he’s always been overly familiar”Does she tell him that she’s uncomfortable or step out from beneath his arm? No, that’d be going against everything that rule number three has taught her. Plus, she wouldn’t want to come across as a “mean bitch” now would she? Just after this, Paul asks her out. “Whenever he’s home he asks me on a date, and I always say no. It’s a ritual.” Is it a ritual? Or is it something more than that? Has Ana, like many of us, been conditioned to follow the rules to such a degree that she doesn’t know how to tell him “It’s not okay to keep asking me out”? Is she so terrified of breaking cultural norms and coming across as a mean-crazy-angry-dyke-shrill-frigid bitch that she’ll put up with his pursuit of her indefinitely? Or does she just not know to put a stop to it because she hasn’t been taught to?When she turns him down, yet again, he goes on to say “Ana, one of these days you’ll say yes.” Creeped out yet? You should be. How does Ana respond to this declaration? By escaping the room they’re in and getting back to a crowded store floor. What does this tell us? She felt the need to flee. She felt the need to not be alone with him. Part of her clearly recognized the danger of the situation and the repeated advances of her “friend”. But instead of speaking up, she fled.She never voices her discomfort. She is the submissive, quiet person that society has taught her to be. And 70 million people have read about her and have had these dangerously passive behaviors reinforced, yet again, through her actions, behaviors and words (or lack thereof).How will this same mentality play out in a situation involving sexual assault? I can tell you, because just a few chapters later, she’s sexually assaulted, by another of her “friends”.“José, I’m okay. I’ve got this.” I try to push him away rather feebly. “Ana, please,” he whispers, and now he’s holding me in his arms, pulling me close.“José, what are you doing?”“You know I like you Ana, please.” He has one hand at the small of my back holding me against him, the other at my chin tipping back my head. Holy fuck…he’s going to kiss me.“No, José, stop – no.” I push him, but he’s a wall of hard muscle, and I cannot shift him. His hand has slipped into my hair, and he’s holding my head in place. “Please, Ana, carińo,” he whispers against my lips… He gently trails kisses along my jaw up to the side of my mouth. I feel panicky, drunk, and out of control. The feeling is suffocating.“José, no,” I plead. I don’t want this.Luckily, Ana is spared further abuse because the one and only Christian Grey arrives on the scene and saves her. How? By saying “I think the lady said no.” That’s right. Ana can try to push José away and tell him ‘no’ multiple times but that’s not good enough. One sentence from a man and José immediately releases her, bringing us back to rule number four: When in trouble, it is best to defer to the protection and judgment of men. You got that, ladies? Don’t try to fight back because you’ll just be ignored, rely instead on a man. Sort of a catch 22 when the one who’s going to get you into trouble will likely also be a man.Bear in mind that this little scene takes place in the parking lot outside of a crowded bar, just a shout away from salvation. You’re probably wondering why Ana didn’t scream. Why she didn’t fight harder. Well, I’d like to bring up Harriet Jacob’s blog post again because just after her “bitch list” she says this:“If we teach women that there are only certain ways they may acceptably behave, we should not be surprised when they behave in those ways.And we should not be surprised when they behave these ways during attempted or completed rapes.Women who are taught not to speak up too loudly or too forcefully or too adamantly or too demandingly are not going to shout “NO” at the top of their goddamn lungs just because some guy is getting uncomfortably close.Women who are taught not to keep arguing are not going to keep saying “NO.”Women who are taught that their needs and desires are not to be trusted, are fickle and wrong and are not to be interpreted by the woman herself, are not going to know how to argue with “but you liked kissing, I just thought…”Women who are taught that physical confrontations make them look crazy will not start hitting, kicking, and screaming until it’s too late, if they do at all…Nobody obtains the superpower to behave dramatically differently during a frightening confrontation. Women will behave the same way they have been taught to behave in all social, professional, and sexual interactions.”Eerie, isn’t it? I sure thought so. Hopefully by now you’re beginning to understand the inflammatory statement this all started with.Not only do Ana’s actions and behaviors throughout the book reinforce the horrible societal conditioning that I mentioned earlier but this series also contains a lot of the other facets of rape culture, like victim silencing. For instance, once she’s collected herself, this happens:“Turning, I glance at José, who looks pretty shamefaced himself and, like me, intimidated by Grey. I glare at him. I have a few choice words for my so-called friend, none of which I can repeat in front of Christian Grey, CEO. Ana, who are you kidding? He’s just seen you hurl all over the ground and into the local flora. There’s no disguising you lack of ladylike behavior.”That’s right folks. It isn’t ladylike to yell (shrill bitch). It isn’t ladylike to swear (crazy bitch). It isn’t ladylike to defend yourself after you’ve just been sexually assaulted (mean bitch). Leave that to the menfolk. Surely they’ll defend you. Surely they’ll be the ones to address the fact that you were just sexually assaulted. Men, you know, the other sex, the ones that have been raised to talk about emotions. In public.And while we’re discussing this scene we can’t forget about rule number eight: Women should always accept and trust the kindness of strangers if they offer help. That’s what Christian is to her at this point in the book. A stranger. She’s seen him only three times, in formal or work-related settings, and knows nothing about him other than he’s rich, good looking and that his shopping list resembles those of serial killers (I’ll get to that last part later in the review). But accept his help and trust his kindness she does. She lets this complete stranger remove her from the bar, assuming that as he’s just saved her from a sexual assault, he&apos;s not planning one of his own.When she wakes up in his suite the next morning, pantsless by the way, she accuses Christian of stalking her. He defends himself by saying:“…if I hadn’t come to get you, you’d probably waking up in the photographer’s (José’s) bed, and from what I can remember, you weren’t overly enthused about him pressing his suit,” he (Christian) says acidly. Pressing his suit! I glance up at Christian. He’s glaring at me, eyes blazing, aggrieved. I try to bit my lip, but I fail to repress my giggle.“Which Medieval chronicle did you escape from? You sound like a courtly knight.”You got that? Stalking’s okay. Because it’s better than being raped.*facepalm*I’m almost at a loss at how to address the rest of this without copious amounts of swearing. How little she’s concerned with her “friend’s” behavior is appalling. That there’s no thought on her end about Christian’s allusion to her rape escape is appalling. How she glosses over it all and makes a fucking joke about it is appalling. It continues by the way.“I would have been fine. I was with Kate.”“And the photographer?” he (Christian) snaps at me.“José just got out of line.” I shrug.A shrug is a dismissive gesture, just in case you were wondering. She dismisses sexual assault as ‘getting out of line’. She downplays the severity of what happened. Why does she do this? Because it’s awkward to talk about it? Because it’s scary to think that someone she knows and trusts assaulted her and that when she tried to push him away and said ‘no’ he ignored her? Guess what? It’s always going to suck to talk about. It’s always scary to realize that statistics say that if you’re raped, you’ll know your attacker. But we need to talk about these things because if we don’t, nothing will ever change.And now the grand finale, victim shaming and blaming. You see, José feels bad for what he did. At first, Ana is pissed at him, as she should be, and even after he calls her numerous times and leaves several messages, she continues to ignore him, deciding to “let him stew”. Then the NEXT DAY, this happens:&quot;The memory of José’s attempted kiss haunts me. I’m beginning to feel a bit cruel not calling him back.&quot;She feels cruel? She feels cruel for not returning the calls of the man that forced himself upon her? Well, of course she does. She&apos;s been trained to be gracious and polite. He&apos;s addressing her. Rule number one has taught her that she should smile in this situation so it would make sense that she feels bad for not doing so. Two days later, they talk:“Can I see you? I’m sorry about Friday night. I was drunk…and you…well. Ana – please forgive me.”“Of course, I forgive you José. Just don’t do it again. You know I don’t feel like that about you.”Here’s where I start to get really angry. “..and you…” what exactly? Were there? Were breathing? Had tits? How can José’s behavior in any way be blamed on Ana? This is the “she deserved to be raped because she was wearing a skirt” mentality that needs to be burned from our collective minds. No one can ever make you do anything. Everything you do, every way you behave is a choice that you and you alone make. So no, there is no “…and you…”.Books like this, with scenes like the ones I’ve spoken about only perpetuate our silence, our ignorance, our discomfort, and our complicity. They reinforce unhealthy behaviors and thinking patterns and they perpetuate rape culture. Authors, I beg you, don’t cover tough issues and strong themes if you can’t do them justice. Grant them the depth and the severity they deserve. Please.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Pinterest
         
        
      Don&apos;t do it!!!!!!! Ughhhhhh. Lmao
    
  
        
      This is all your fault, Andrea.
    
  
        
      Me?!?! I take no responsibility for Fifty. ;p But. Imagine Barrons on the receiving end of the red room of pain for a moment. *cough*
    
  
        
      Oh. My. God. Barrons as a dom...*gulp*
    
  
        
      See?!? See?!? He fits so many scenarios. Yum yum.
    
  
        
      WHY DO YOU DO THIS TO YOURSELF?
    
  
        
      Don&apos;t read. Just go to SnarkSquad.com and read their recaps. Save your brain cells/soul.
    
  
        
      I&apos;m trying to kick start my Fever recovery. For whatever reason, the hangover hit me hard this time around and I&apos;ve learned the only cure for it is reading something that I&apos;ll probably hate or find utterly ridiculous. This seemed like my best bet on both counts.
    
  
        
      I never said that I liked it but that I was intrigued by it. I read it when it first came out and hadn&apos;t read anything with BDSM in it before.
    
  
        
      Also, I think I said I didn&apos;t hate it. That&apos;s changing on a re-read. The closer I pay attention, the more disturbing this book becomes. And not just because of Ana and Christian&apos;s...relationship.
    
  
        
      LOL, yup! I think it&apos;s because I started off saying that I didn&apos;t hate it. Then I went into why and then Sarah and Aure started suggesting consensual BDSM books. Now that I&apos;ve read a few of them this is even MORE fucked up.
    
  
        
      Couldn&apos;t you just re-reread Fever again?I mean... THIS?
    
  
        
      Oh no. This shit NEEDS to happen. The longer I read this, the longer my rant about how it does nothing but perpetuate rape culture gets. TIME FOR ANOTHER PSA STYLE REVIEW.
    
  
        
      What&apos;s just as bad as the fucked up story is the horrendous writing. Good idea to read something you&apos;ll hate after Fever, but this isn&apos;t worth your hate. Hate keeps it alive, and it just needs to disappear already.
    
  
        
      There&apos;s no way in hell I will re-read these.
    
  
        
      I actually think I needed to. I read them when they first came out and every time I see the ranting reviews about them I kept thinking &quot;Is it really that bad? I don&apos;t really remember.&quot;I now have my answer...
    
  
        
      I&apos;m trying to forcibly exorcise Barrons from my brain. It&apos;s working so far.
    
  
        
      DAMN IT THAT&apos;S NOT HELPING! STOPIT!
    
  
        
      Take a shot every time the phrase &apos;inner goddess&apos; is used. The alcohol poisoning is better than reading the rest of the book ;)

I liked them at the time. Well, didn&apos;t hate the first one anyway. 2 and 3 were shite. Now, looking back at all I&apos;ve read. They&apos;re all shite.And Barrons is the cure for whatever ails ya.
    
  
        
      @ Rebecca: LMFAO. People keep saying that. I actually found several FSoG drinking games, all of which looked to lead to liver failure. @ Catherine: Exactly! I was in the same boat, I didn&apos;t hate them. Now...
    
  
        
      Yay, you&apos;re done! I hope you came out not too badly scarred.
    
  
        
      Oh, I&apos;m not done yet Elaine. Only about 1/3 of the way through. The rating is from my first read of this series.
    
  
        
      Oops. Umm, good luck for your sanity and I think you might be needing a negative rating scale heh.
    
  
        
      Man I can&apos;t wait for your review. Are you going to read the others? I read the second and couldn&apos;t do it anymore.
    
  
        
      I think I&apos;ll stop after this one. I can&apos;t do that to myself. The review is going to be pretty long judging by my notes. And it&apos;ll be a PSA style like the one for Hopeless only much more in depth. I&apos;ve been doing frigging research Bonnie.
    
  
        
      LOL I hadn&apos;t read that one before. Yeah, I never really had any desire to read that. The high ratings bothered me.
    
  
        
      That was the first time I realized that I should be leery of such high ratings. Now whenever I see anything above a 4.2 I know to steer clear unless I see glowing reviews from people I trust.
    
  
        
      Honestly, I&apos;ve stayed away from the NA genre completely. There are a few I&apos;ll consider... one of these days. It all seems like the same freaking crap and I&apos;m sure that&apos;s super narrow-minded of me and I need to be more &apos;adventurous&apos; and at least give it a shot but... no thanks. Like you, not unless they&apos;re rated high from people I trust.
    
  
        
      Smart woman. I&apos;ve rage-quit the genre as a whole.
    
  
        
      I keep hearing a lot of fab things (from some reliable friends) about this one: Unteachable. Still uncertain.
    
  
        
      Ooh, I actually added that one after seeing Wendy and Emily&apos;s reviews. BUT NO MORE. Okay fine, I&apos;ll continue to make exceptions. But sparingly.
    
  
        
      That&apos;s why I added it too. I can trust those two. Emily&apos;s doing that NA Experiment and she definitely deserves a medal for that. Lol
    
  
        
      I&apos;m thinking of shipping her a case of wine to ease her troubles.
    
  
        
      I&apos;m sure she&apos;d appreciate that.
    
  
        
      I put a few books on my to-read list like Hopeless and Unteachable but I think I&apos;m just going to avoid the entire Contemporary Romance and New Adult (what does that even mean) genres. They&apos;re just not my cuppa. I&apos;ll have to read some pretty convincing reviews to make me wanna go there again.
    
  
        
      New Adult typically seems to encompass every book where the MC is 19-24 and in which horrific tropes and themes found in old school bodice rippers relive their glory days.
    
  
        
      I guess that&apos;s why I get that behavior in historical romance, because it&apos;s almost like a fantasy-land. But in what&apos;s supposed to be modern, contemporary times? No way, Jose. That stuff just doesn&apos;t fly with me. Not to mention the fact that I don&apos;t know ANYONE who remotely resembles these characters (thank god).
    
  
        
      If I ever meet anyone like Christian Grey I&apos;m going to get arrested.
    
  
        
      Ha!
    
  
        
      Litchick wrote: &quot;New Adult typically seems to encompass every book where the MC is 19-24 and in which horrific tropes and themes found in old school bodice rippers relive their glory days.&quot;I remember a thread in one of my Goodreads groups discussing if the genre &quot;label&quot; (YA, NA, etc.) is a descriptor of the content or of the target audience. I argued the titles YA and NA mostly refer to the content, not the target audience. But then, shouldn&apos;t NA be YA and YA be Teen (or AA for almost adult)? New Adult just seems silly anyway when we already have Contemporary Romance and those seem mostly to have young women as the MC. I&apos;m freakin&apos; 42 and can count on one hand how many CR books I&apos;ve read with an MC my age.I get the confusion because I think with YA especially, the content is mostly geared towards teens and young adults, even though it can skate along that sexually inappropriate line. And I know this is a bit of a stretch, but Historical Romance isn&apos;t geared towards ladies from the 18th century, it&apos;s a description of content. I think this sometimes confuses teens and their parents when wondering what is appropriate for a 16 year old as opposed to a 25 year old. But then, I&apos;m probably over-analyzing this. I can do that. Get back to your NA/Erotic/BDSM/OMFG/Mommy Porn already.
    
  
        
      LOOOOOOL! I don&apos;t think you&apos;re over analyzing if it&apos;s any consolation. I think your NA/YA, YA/AA switch up is pretty sound.
    
  
        
      This is definitely the most brilliant review I&apos;ve read for this book.Excuse me while I go email this to everyone I have ever met.
    
  
        
      Oh snap! Thank you so much, Alisa!
    
  
        
      Good god, woman. I just got home so I&apos;ll read the entire thing later, but I can tell scrolling through that this is going to be just fucking epic. You always deliver.
    
  
        
      It&apos;s just begun, mwah ha ha ha ha
    
  
        
      I plan on reaching GR&apos;s max words allowed with this sucker.
    
  
        
      @Litchick As a guy, I totally approve of this review! This review is awesome, I can&apos;t wait to read more!
    
  
        
      Thank you, Scott! Don&apos;t worry, I haven&apos;t forgotten about the men. My fiance is working with me on the &quot;Why this sends a bad/confusing message to men&quot; section.
    
  
        
      I love your review. Holy fuck, woman! You really did your research. *applause*

           You know, I was beginning to wonder if I needed to change some of my two star books to one star. I was thinking that I might not ever personally read a book worthy of one star, and I was messing up my scale by giving some of the more lame books I&apos;ve read lately two stars instead of one.Thank you E.L. James, for proving to me there was something worth waiting for. Something that truly exemplifies the meaning of terrible.Now hold up, all you would-be defenders. I read this whole thing. I did not skip anything, I did not skim, I read every word. I bought this book with the intention of giving it the benefit of the doubt. You see, I love erotica, and I&apos;m not ashamed to say that I both read (as you see on my 2012 books I&apos;ve already read two others) and write it myself. So I was thinking to myself, oh, maybe there&apos;s a possibility that even though this is a twi-fiction rewrite, and even though everyone makes fun of it, it could still be a fun little guilty-pleasure read that I can laugh along with.NO.NO.NO.NO.This book is NOT:- erotic/sexy- funny, even ironically- endearing- full of sexual taboosThis book IS:- repetitive- plotless (well, you knew that)- painful to get through- depicting manipulative, controlling, and self-destructive as desirable- how to not write a novel- how to gain success by using other people&apos;s characters, barely changing them and then laughing all the way to the bankMost people know about the twilight matchups so I&apos;m not going to go into too much detail, but it was actually quite sickening, how lazy she was to change ANY story details:Bella Anastasia, a clumsy girl who grew up in Arizona Las Vegas with her mother, then moved to Forks Vancouver, Washington where her dad stepdad lives, while her mother lives with her new husband in Florida Georgia. She has a younger friend named Jacob Jose with a crush on her, and whose dad is friends with her dad, because they are fishing partners and police force army buddies, and who gave her his old truck VW beetle.Edward Christian, who is adopted and has a sibling named Emmett Elliott and a sister named Alice Mia, also adopted, who live with their parents Carlisle Carrick (really? CARRICK? We couldn&apos;t even change the first three letters?) and Esme Grace. Their father mother is a doctor. Rose Kate and Jasper Ethan are also siblings in this story, but have been changed to be friends of Anastasia, since in Twilight they already have a convenient different last name than the other Cullens.Also, he &apos;dazzles&apos; her.I can&apos;t even function over the fact that upon preparing this book for publishing she couldn&apos;t change one fucking thing to make it even remotely different. That was too hard. TOO DAMN HARD. The similarities in character are so untouched that I am sincerely appalled that she thought it &apos;different&apos; enough to publish as is. It&apos;s quite disgusting.Alright, continuing on, and once again, I&apos;m sure you&apos;ve heard this already: this book is terribly written. Most notably the lack of ability to describe anything other than the few choice phrases she knows how to type. He ran his hands through his hair. I bit my lip. He told me not to bite my lip. Oh jeez. He grabbed me by the chin to make me look up at him. Holy crap. I peeked up at him. Lather rinse repeat. Over. And over. And over. For 500 pages. Then there&apos;s the case of multiple personality disorder, where she hears the voices of two distinct other pieces of herself in her head. The subconscious, the one telling her she&apos;s not good enough, and the inner goddess, the one that&apos;s all into the sex. It&apos;s strange because I&apos;m also currently reading a book right now, Deadline, where the main character hears a voice in his head because he is literally insane, and it&apos;s written almost the exact same way, he talks back to his voice, who presents herself in italics, just as Anastasia talks back to her two italics voices. It&apos;s funny because she&apos;s supposed to be completely normal, and yet shares the same schizophrenic tendencies as a book about someone who is completely insane. This is sense. Check out this awesome short paragraph from chapter 24:“Through the haze of light, I squint and see Christian leaning over me, smiling. Amused. Amused at me. Dressed! In black.”What are these fragments, four in a row. What is this punctuation. GASP AT HIM BEING CLOTHED. Is this supposed to be poetry?Let me add some line breaks for poetic interest:Through the haze of light, I squint and see ,Christian leaning over me, Smiling. Amused. Amused at me. Dressed! In black.That&apos;s almost better.Let&apos;s have another, shall we, from chapter 24 once more:“I didn&apos;t put that song on my iPod,” he says casually, and puts his foot down so that I am thrown back into my seat as the car accelerates along the freeway.What? He knows what he&apos;s doing, the bastard. Who did? And I have to listen to Britney going on and on. Who...who?The song ends and the iPod shuffles to Damien Rice being morunful. Who? Who? I stare out the window, my stomach churning. Who?SAY WHO AGAIN, BITCH. JUST TRY IT, I DARE YOU.Okay and now, maybe even worse than the writing (oh hell, nothing&apos;s worse than the writing, nevermind) is the lack of plot. Now once again, you already know this. Do I even need to tell you nothing happens? Seeing as it&apos;s based off of a book where nothing happens, you can be guaranteed that as we go one step removed, even less happens. Here is the part where I apologize to Twilight, where I said, in my page by page commentary below, that 50 Shades was more entertaining. I was at the very beginning. I was young and naïve. I didn&apos;t realize. I&apos;m sorry. You know how The Office kind of got bad after Jim and Pam got together, because there was really nothing you were waiting for after that? This happens by like...chapter 2. You&apos;re like...okay....what, now we jut have to watch them whine as a couple for the next zillion pages? Okay. I can&apos;t even fathom that there are two other books written about this couple. I literally want to open the window and invite birds to eat my eyes out as punishment for buying and reading this book.And now for a bit of tiddlybits, I&apos;m going to share some information on storywriting that you guys might find interesting, and will help show exactly why 50 Shades has zero plot. I went to school for film, and we had story development classes. One thing we were beaten over the head with about is something called the 7 Sentence Story. This will help for any writers that are writing their books to be cinematic or would like their novel to be considered for film purposes (this is by no means a rule, but a really helpful guideline). First, you need a problem, a conflict. A reason to tell a story. Once you have that, your plot should be able to be described in seven sentences thusly:Exposition: we are introduced to the protagonist and/or main charactersInciting Incident: something happens that kicks off the conflict, the whole point of the storyPlot Point 1: because of the inciting incident, character sets off to do something/correct the problem, etcMidpoint: here in film you might see a montage, but it&apos;s a place where either plot point 1 is resolved or there is a transition in the characters way of thinkingPlot Point 2: often an even bigger issue arises, or a twist that changes or accelerates the conflictClimax: final showdown or decisions needed to be madeResolution.: everything comes to an end, the conflict is settled in one way or anotherBasically, if you can tell your story in this way in seven sentences, you&apos;ll know that A) the main point is clear, B) that your story doesn&apos;t wander too much in different directions, and C) that you actually have a plot to stand on, that you can justify there&apos;s enough substance there. And since that&apos;s a lot of vagueness, we&apos;ll go with a classic captive/dominant story to show how one tells a story in seven sentences: Disney&apos;s Beauty and the Beast. First, the main conflict:Conflict: The prince has been turned into a beast and has only a limited time left before he is trapped forever as one.And the seven sentence story: Exposition: Belle is a smart girl who rejects the advances of Gaston, as she doesn&apos;t want to be stuck in a mundane life.Inciting Incident: Belle&apos;s father gets lost and captured by the Beast in his castle.Plot Point 1: Belle trades her freedom for her father and is prisoner in the castle.Midpoint: Belle starts to experience feelings for the Beast and is complacent.Plot Point 2: Belle&apos;s father is sick, and the Beast decides to let her go, even though he&apos;s giving up his chances of being with her.Climax: Gaston comes with an angry mob to destroy the Beast.Resolution: While Beast lays dying, his love for Belle turns him back into a human and he can live with her happily ever after. Simple, right? Of course, other things happen, but no doubt you can communicate the main story with just these sentences. Okay, so let&apos;s try 50 Shades, which, hilariously, has had its film rights bought already. Conflict: Anastasia must decide whether to be with a guy who she thinks is super hot but also scares her (This fascinating decision, I tell you what.)Exposition: Anastasia is a literary student at WSU.Inciting Incident: Anastasia meets Christian on page 7, and thinks he&apos;s hot and mysterious and also frustrating. It is clear they both have chemistry.Plot Point 1, which is sloppy and all over the place: Christian chases her down, brings her to his house and shows her he&apos;s into S&amp;M. Also they have sex.Sorta Midpoint, but kind of squished close to Plot Point 1: Anastasia must decide whether to pledge herself to him via contract if she wants to continue seeing him. Plot Point 2: Nah, she&apos;s still deciding and whining about how he&apos;s kind of scary but continues to have sex with him throughout this whole time. There is no plot point 2.Climax: Well there isn&apos;t really one, it&apos;s just kind of an all over the place ending...either the more complicated sex scene at the end with the hymnal music or him hitting with her with the belt the next morning, one of the two I guess...Resolution: She says he&apos;s too weird and ends it. What a complex, thrilling, and incredible plot full of depth. SHOULD I HAVE CUT THAT FOR SPOILERS? OOPS? Did you even care? If you&apos;ve gotten this far, nope.But guess what. We know that there are two other books and they get together and lesson isn&apos;t really learned so AWESOME, COOL. I guess that&apos;s how she gets people to buy the next ones because hot diggedy I can&apos;t wait to see them get back together and whine some more.And let&apos;s talk about the sex for a moment. Nothing forbidden actually happens that you&apos;ll be like ohhhh how scandalous I want to try that. For the most part it&apos;s pretty much all basic stuff or basic toy play, because basically he&apos;s taking it easier on her since she&apos;s inexperienced. Except for the belt part at the end, I guess, which just doesn&apos;t sound fun.And you already heard about the tampon, so like, that&apos;s not even a surprise (although imo it&apos;s not a big deal anyway. Out of all the women having sex on their periods regularly, I can guarantee you there are quite a few men that are tasked with taking the tampon out and throwing it aside.) I was actually more upset about the fact that she is sleeping completely naked in a hotel room bed on day two of her period. As if that isn&apos;t going to be a mess in the morning.Okay lest I go on as long as the book, you get the point. If you want to see more, my commentary while reading it is below. However, a few things:-I cannot stand how much the author being middle aged shows from the point of view of this 21 year old. “I&apos;m gonna buy plane tickets...on the Internet.” ARE YOU NOW? WHOAOOOAOAOA. Don&apos;t get crazy on us, I might be too overwhelmed by this turn of events. “I fired up my email.” BLAZING SPEEDS REQUIRED.-They actually do the “you hang up” “no you hang up” “no you” that gross couples tend to do. And it was, expectedly, gross.-Someone on ONTD who liked this book yelled at me because I said that Christian is not a dominant (they also said I wasn&apos;t &apos;experienced enough to understand,&apos; lol okay, like you know who I am, anon.) I still stand by that statement. It&apos;s not what he&apos;s doing, it&apos;s how he&apos;s doing it. He is deeply troubled, whiny, and manipulative, and while he does love control, it&apos;s for the wrong reasons. He was abused as a child, and sexually abused as a 15 year old and vastly denies it, and because of this he justifies his activities as personal preference when he is in fact a bit too fucked up to currently have a relationship. He ends up making the naïve Anastasia batshit crazy because he continues to string her along, trying to convince her they want the same things, instead of getting himself some help.-He gives her the illusion that she has the choice to back out, but then turns around and says ha-ha I&apos;m joking but I know where to find you by the way. She goes to visit her mother because she needs a break from him to think, and what does he do? Flies out there, using his roundabout stalker way of finding information about where she&apos;s at, like he always does, to meet up, have sex with her and take her out with him. She&apos;s supposed to be visiting her mother and having time to think, yet he can&apos;t stay away and makes this about HIM, taking her away from time with her mom whom she hasn&apos;t seen in 6 months. I can&apos;t at this selfish fucking bastard because he just can&apos;t stay away.It makes me mad just thinking about someone that clingy. Which is another thing that pisses me off, almost everything about their whining and relationship conversations reminds me of everything I&apos;ve hated about past relationships I&apos;ve had. How does ANYONE enjoy this book? How does anyone think that this is sexy, that this depicts something they want?I can&apos;t even.I cannot.(Also I should never have imagined Chuck and Blair from Gossip Girl as the main characters. Now everytime I see a commercial for Gossip Girl, rage courses through my body.)I&apos;m bored. Someone get me out of here.P.S. Did you know that James recently stated she&apos;s set the bar for writing pretty high?Cool.Please, do yourself a favor and go buy a book of much higher quality plot and writing, ohhhh like....Modelland.
         
        
      I like to think so. I helped make this win as the April snark book for ONTD club and I best read it so as not to be the only one who didn&apos;t, after I worked so hard to get it voted for, lol. I just do it for the lulz.
    
  
        
      Good luck with this one dear Wigs. I&apos;m loving the images and await your review with giddy anticipation. I pretty much found this to be utter bull, but the only way to understand the extent of it&apos;s bullishness is to read it for yourself. Good on you!
    
  
      OMG I cant wait for this review!
    
  
        
      oh god, I saw this book at BN today and i thought it&apos;d be like 8 dollars since its a paperback and it&apos;s cheap perverted fanfiction turned book, but its like 16. I was going to read it for the shits and giggles but like hell I&apos;m doing it now o.o
    
  
        
      OMG this made my day ... :D The Dumbledore pic is epic lol
    
  
        
      hah hah I read the tampon scene and that was enough. Plus, I like when Rodger from Family Guy reads excerpts on ONTD - that&apos;ll do for me!
    
  
        
      Excellent review, Wigs! Love it.
    
  
        
      Wow, I&apos;m so sorry to hear about your suffering. This book is offensive to humanity. I have a friend that likes this book and she&apos;s telling me to read it, I am considering if I should continue talking to this girl.

      I&apos;ve been told by multiple people that I didn&apos;t know what a real Dom was.... Cus the people out there reading a twific and loving the sexy S&amp;M clearly know what they&apos;re talking about, and that I was jealous..... I&apos;m not a writer what would I be jealous for that she&apos;s making tons of money off a crappy rip off? Yes actually I am a bit :-). Great review!
    
  
        
      I love Chuck and Blair! X)Too bad you assigned them a bad role to play. XDD
    
  
        
      Your review just dazzled me. LoL
    
  
        
      I love this review SO MUCH.
    
  
        
      I read the first smutty section to my husband, as he wanted to see what the fuss was about after the SNL skit. HE FELL ASLEEP. I woke him up laughing at the cheap devices like Christian Grey having GREY eyes, and the use of the same noun twice in one sentence (Something like &apos;he unzipped his jeans then slid his jeans off&apos;, IIRC.) I just couldn&apos;t get past that.
    
  
        
      I... quite possibly love you. Can I keep you? I am in love with how you reviewed this. I giggled far too many times. And your progress reading comments....*dead*

      This review made my day!
    
  
        
      This was absolutely perfect! I love how you compared Bella *cough* I mean Ana to Shaun in Deadline. Let&apos;s not pretend Ana isn&apos;t totally nuts here people, she continues to place herself in a relationship with a man who admits he wants to physically hurt her for his own pleasure. This review should be mandatory reading for anyone who is even slightly considering reading this book. Great job Wigs!
    
  
        
      I was laughing at this review so hard I almost woke up the whole house! LOL! Awesomeness surrounds this! And you know the funny thing? James went on the Today show and said she didn&apos;t know why people bought this book, she can&apos;t even write well. Then before she was on 20/20 and said, she loves that people are buying her book. THEN she went on another show and said what you quoted, that she set the bar for writing pretty high. I masochistically watch every interview she does, just to watch her inconsistent babble, and wonder why none of her &apos;fans&apos; pick up on this. It is the first thing I notice before ranting all over the house that this woman has made millions off a crap writing job!
    
  
        
      I dated a girl who was interested in being spanked. We tried it, but it didn&apos;t do it for her. I joked that I could use my belt; I expected her to find that funny, but she got really excited by the thought of it and immediately asked me to try it. I did so reluctantly, and she LOVED it. The relationship ended shortly thereafter, as I am neither a sadist nor a masochist, and from that point on she began demanding more and more abuse.So yes, some people do enjoy that sort of thing.BTW, love the review! (And that Dumbledore pic IS epic).
    
  
        
      This review seriously just made my freakin day. I love how blunt you are! and the pictures? HAHAHA :)
    
  
        
      That was an entertaining and well done review.
    
  
        
      Well done. Also I&apos;m using your 7 sentence story structure it&apos;s really helping me :).
    
  
        
      Lou Eli wrote: &quot;Well done. Also I&apos;m using your 7 sentence story structure it&apos;s really helping me :).&quot;Oh yes! I definitely think it is really helpful. Before presenting the concepts of our thesis films we were required to submit the ideas in 7 Sentence Story form so the professors would know we had enough story to work with.I think it&apos;s definitely helpful when developing a plot to know that you have a natural flow between your main points so you know you&apos;re not just writing aimlessly.
    
  
        
      69 likes! I would like this review now, but I don&apos;t want to spoil that number. It&apos;s not often that numbers can be sexual in any way. And, considering the book this review is about, I think it&apos;s quite appropriate, don&apos;t you?

(Although they don&apos;t ever 69 in the book.) But here&apos;s to hoping it goes even higher! (feel free to like at any time, mel)
    
  
        
      You happy now? I tried to resist, but your review was more than amusing, so I didn&apos;t have the heart to deny your request. (Plus, who doesn&apos;t want to see a friend&apos;s review reach that big 1 double oh? Think of me when you reach a 100, okay? *wipes tear*)I can&apos;t believe they don&apos;t 69. Considering everything else they are likely to do, you&apos;d think they&apos;d 69 just to get past the basics! Jeez. But then, why bother with something as mundane as a 69er when you have a torture rack handy?!
    
  
        
      Damn, you have 70 likes now, the magic is gone *cries into a pillow* Seriously though, didn&apos;t it make you want to gauge your eyes out? And what was up with all the murmuring? Could they not speak loudly like every one else on earth?

Lip biting has been forever ruined. FOREVER.
    
  
        
      I&apos;m glad I was never a lip biter because if I&apos;d been one, I would be spending these last few days trying desperately to fix myself into not being one anymore just because of this stupid book.Also, El Jamesito said she raised WHAT to WHAT extent? *drools in uncontrollable anger*
    
  
        
      This review is hilarious and makes me glad I couldn&apos;t even get through a skim-read of the book for LOLs. Clearly I saved myself some pain (oh god when you made that sentence fragment paragraph into a poem, I DIED).
    
  
        
      Someone on ONTD who liked this book yelled at me because I said that Christian is not a dominant (they also said I wasn&apos;t &apos;experienced enough to understand,&apos; lol okay, like you know who I am, anon.)Dude. I saw that exchange when I was backreading ONTD posts on this the other day. And the same person kept complaining that, &quot;None of you have actually read the book, YOU&apos;RE JUST LAUGHING AT THE TAMPON EXCERPT!!!1&quot; It was very strange.Also, this review made me laugh out loud, especially the excerpts and poetry. :D GOOD JOB.
    
  
        
      Excellent review is excellent. This was one of the best ones yet.
    
  
        
      I was still irked at you for actually giving this woman money, but I may have gotten over it with this review. I wish I could like this multiple times. I wish I had seen that person on ONTD. That could have been fun for me.

But I wasn&apos;t gonna read it otherwise and I at least brought some people joy with the review. Btw did you notice you&apos;re the reigning queen of the 50 shades reviews? I use a different web browser to see where we all fall into place (cuz when you&apos;re logged in you and your friends reviews are all kept in separate areas from the rest) and yours is the number 1 review for 50 Shades! :D haha
    
  
        
      Hilarious and wonderfully written review. :) Thank you for suffering so that others won&apos;t have to. I&apos;ve been tempted to read the books, but this has killed most of my temptation...

I snorted. Oh, and I just learned a new trick about that. If you click on &quot;default&quot; at the beginning of the community reviews it&apos;ll show you the real order of the reviews with yours and your friends included. I almost facepalmed when that got explained to me, because I was doing the same as you and looking in another browser.

      This book makes me think lightning must have struck Barbara Cartland&apos;s grave and reanimated her corpse. It&apos;s the only explanation.
    
  
        
      You know I only read the 1-star reviews for this book and laugh my ass off. Sounds stupid right? I have no intention of reading this book. Ever. The first review I read totally made my mind up about that. Yours is possibly the third review that I am reading for this book and man was this hilarious! I am going to read this all over again now and laugh maniacally. It was truly awesome! Thanks for making my day!

What in the hell just happened? Did I really read that? Oh, my god, I did. I did read that. Meet Anastasia Steele:
  
Ana is just a giant mess of a human being. She&apos;s insecure to the point of it being laughable, &apos;klutzy&apos; (even though she only trips twice in the entire book), and a complete ditz. She&apos;s a virgin (of course) who&apos;s never taken any sexual interest in anyone before. Right. I&apos;m fairly certain there hasn&apos;t been a woman this naive since &apos;round about 1954. At one point, she thinks putting her hair in pigtails will keep her safe from Christian&apos;s lusty advances. Fuckin&apos; really? She &quot;flushes&quot; constantly, and on several occasions referred to her hoo-hoo-naughty place as &quot;down there.&quot;
  
Next, we have Christian Grey:
  
Christian is a misogynistic, self-loathing, abusive piece of shit. Apparently, his only redeeming qualities are, in this order; his ridiculous good looks, his money, and his giant penis. The only time Ana seems to like him as a person is when he&apos;s being &quot;lovable&quot;, and those times are few and far between. Most of the time he&apos;s serious, brooding, and threatening. How charming.I knew from the very first line this wasn&apos;t going to be good. 
  &quot;I scowl with frustration at myself in the mirror.&quot;
 It was cemented that early, my deep, deep dislike for this moronic, simpering asshole. Your hair won&apos;t behave? Guess what?
  
My suspicions were confirmed a few pages later when Ana admits that any &quot;sympathy&quot; she feels for her sick friend is &quot;unwelcome&quot;. Unwelcome, apparently because her friend is beautiful, even when she has the flu...? What a petty, jealous cunt. The only thing that made the first 4% of this book tolerable was the fact that I read it aloud to my younger brother, and his frequent commentary was amusingly distracting. Once he gave up, however, I had to travel the rest of the road alone. What a painful journey it was. My first impressions of Ana were bad (deservedly so). What were my first impressions of Christian? Well...
  
That&apos;s how I felt about Christian Grey. From the beginning. Any time an author tries to sell me on a character&apos;s &quot;charm&quot; by waxing hormonal about how &quot;ridiculously good-looking&quot; he is, I snicker inwardly. I can&apos;t think why....
  
Huh.Anyway, after reading about the description of Christian&apos;s building (hello, first penis metaphor), I had to sit through the awful dialogue between these smarmy idiots and hope beyond hope that something, anything, would distract me enough to see me through to the end. Turns out, I found something about 15% through. I went back and counted, and kept track throughout the rest of the book, and do you have any idea how many fucking times Ana said &quot;Oh my&quot; in this monumentally bad missive? Do you? I&apos;ll tell you; 79! 79 motherfucking times. &quot;He pulled me back against his chest...oh my.&quot; &quot;He began kissing a trail down my belly, oh my.&quot; &quot;He&apos;s an insufferable douchenozzle, oh my!&quot; (I&apos;m just thankful that neither lions, tigers, nor bears were brought into this mess at any point.)
  
About halfway through, I wished I&apos;d been keeping track of the word &quot;crap&quot; because Ana is constantly saying/thinking it. Crap, Holy Crap, Double and Triple Crap, Oh Crap, This Crap, That Crap, any and all Crap. Speaking of crap, if I ever, ever ever have to hear/read the words &quot;inner goddess&quot; again, I&apos;m going to construct a pyre out of tampons and maxi pads, light it, and toss unsuspecting women into it. 
  
^My inner goddess will cap yours in the face if you don&apos;t shut the fuck up^I&apos;m sorry, I just couldn&apos;t take any of this seriously. His playroom. His playroom? Really?
  
Or how about his weird-ass issues with food? He wants the girl slim and in shape, yet he won&apos;t stop trying to force her to eat!
  
I simply love the attempt E.L. James made at giving these pathetic shells personalities. Ana wears Converse, drives a vintage car, and likes classic British lit. *Yawn* haven&apos;t heard any of that before. And Christian; we know Christian&apos;s super deep and sophisticated because he plays the piano and listens to obscure classical music. This is how we know Edward Christian is really just a lost soul in need of love; his love of music. Everyone knows that no one threatening listens to music. Music lovers just aren&apos;t capable of doing anything bad.
  
^Surprise! Psychos like music, too.^Since this is considered nothing more than &quot;mommy porn&quot;, I will attempt to pander to that particular demographic for a moment. Were the sex scenes well-written? Well, none of it was particularly well-written. The sex scenes could be kind of...honestly, they were kind of boring. I&apos;ve had more exciting sex myself, so I guess reader response to the sex scenes is dependent on reader experience. There&apos;s nothing revolutionary here, and a lot of it is just plain unrealistic. I mean, come on, he pretty much jackhammers her hymen and she walks away with nothing more than a passing, pleasant soreness? Riiiight. How about the time he gives her a handjob with a soapy washcloth? Hello? Apparently neither one of them has ever heard of a urinary tract infection. Oh, or we could talk about her first time giving Christian a blowjob, during which Ana established herself as some kind of Queen of Deepthroat.
  
Anyone wanna hear about the tampon scene? Oh, you&apos;ve already heard about the tampon scene? Yeah, same here, although hearing about it and reading the actual scene are a bit different. For some reason, you imagine it being worse than it actually is, while at the same time, reading about it is more horrifying than you could possibly imagine. 
  &quot;He reaches between my legs and pulls on the blue string...what! And...gently pulls my tampon out and tosses it into the nearby toilet.&quot;

  
Look, I&apos;m not against sex during menses, but a guy plucking out a girl&apos;s tampon? Yeah, gross. I&apos;m not a prude, but there are certain lines people just shouldn&apos;t cross. What makes it worse is that Christian is just thrilled that Ana&apos;s raggin&apos; because he hates using condoms.
  
Apparently, Mr. GinormoDick doesn&apos;t know that a woman can get pregnant while on her period. Which is hilarious considering all the teaching and training he&apos;s doing to remedy Ana&apos;s sexual ignorance. Sexual dependence, thy name is Anastasia Steele. We&apos;re supposed to believe that this girl has gone 21 years neither having had sex nor masturbating? Hm. Well, Christian&apos;s supposed sexual prowess makes a bit more sense now, as does Ana&apos;s assertion that he has a giant bologna wand. She has absolutely zero experience, and she&apos;s never once had anything &quot;in there&quot;. Thing could be the size of a baby carrot and she&apos;d still be like, &quot;Oh, my glob! How is it ever going to fit?!&quot; It&apos;s good that she stockpiled all those potential orgasms, though, because now she&apos;s capable of having like, 15 a day or something. It&apos;s ridiculous. Come to think of it, Christian&apos;s obsession with her eating habits makes a bit more sense now. She was probably beginning to look like something out of a horror movie.
  
Seriously, though, are we going to take the word of a girl who is apparently so undersexed she&apos;s never even masturbated? I guess I can sort of understand this obsession with some kind of an awakening, but...really? &quot;Oh, he&apos;s soooo good in bed!&quot; How the hell would she know?! She has absolutely nothing with which to compare, not even her own damn hand! 
  
Now I&apos;ll be totally honest, the biggest issue I have with Fifty Shades of Shit is neither the sex nor the horrible writing. It&apos;s the plot. Thin as it is, it&apos;s still there, its core message being that, given enough time, you can change someone. While I don&apos;t have any problem with this if all you&apos;re trying to do is help them to lose weight or quit smoking, when you&apos;re talking about an emotionally and (dangerously close to) physically abusive relationship, sending that kind of message is ridiculous and irresponsible. Christian is controlling, possessive, condescending, and cruel. He doesn&apos;t allow Ana to behave as she normally would, and Ana just puts up with it, insistent that if she can give him what he wants, when he wants, as often as he wants, she can eventually begin to pull his strings. Will it work? In the books, probably. In real life? No. Almost never. How many misguided women are going to waste their lives on some emotionally retarded prick because they&apos;ve read shit like this and think this kind of fucked-up fairytale will come true for them? I&apos;ve known women with this mentality. &quot;Oh, he&apos;s so dark and dangerous and threatening, but he&apos;s got a sad, lonely side, and if I could just figure out what&apos;s wrong, I could change him!&quot; 
  
Wake the fuck up! He may be hot, he may have a huge dick, he may even be rich, that doesn&apos;t make him a good person. It doesn&apos;t even make him a potentially good person. Quit.Being.A.Fucking.Idiot. (Look, I can make my words Staccato like Christian. Now hold still while I choke you until you pass out...)
  
^Ana and Christian^ - &quot;I said don&apos;t roll your eyes at me!!&quot;Christian stalks Ana (which she turns into a fucking joke), and whispers things to her &quot;threateningly&quot;. She&apos;s constantly afraid he&apos;s going to beat the crap out of her, and with good reason as he, on more than one occasion, tells her he&apos;s going to/wants to.Potential rape is downplayed. Ana&apos;s friend, Jake Jose, starts pushing himself on her rather vehemently when they&apos;re both drunk. Ana repeatedly says no, but Jose just keeps trying to go in for the kill. Admiral Chaps busts on up with his riding crop, however, and saves her. Ana (understandably) avoids Jose for a while after that, and when her other friend asks her why, all Ana says is, &quot;He made a pass at me.&quot; Later on, she and Jose are friends again, the &quot;attempted kiss&quot; forgotten. *Sigh*Rapists appear to be a theme. Christian tells Ana that he gets off on having complete and total control over another person. This is not just in the bedroom, but in Ana&apos;s overall life. On several occasions, he fails to yield when Ana says no, plunging on regardless, assured she&apos;ll like whatever he does, anyway, so why bother stopping?
  
And there are women out there who think this is romantic.
  
I wish you the best of luck, ladies. Just keep in mind that while you&apos;re fantasizing about abusive, misogynistic assholes like Grey, there are a lot of women dealing with the horrors of actually living with men like him. For all you ladies bustin&apos; out your toys while daydreaming about Hunky Mr. Grey, I want you to do something for me. It&apos;ll only take a moment. Close your eyes. Think about all the things Christian Grey does in the book. Not just those supposed sweet things, but really, everything. His condescension, his control, his insane jealousy, his threats.....and now....imagine he looks like this:
  
Still turned on? The end of the book was absolutely hilarious, with Ana fleeing in emotional tumult because Christian can&apos;t give her what she needs (love! *sniff*).
  
And we&apos;re treated to her alternately being angry about the pain and humiliation she faced at Christian&apos;s hands, and chastising herself for being a failure and for being mean to Christian. It really is classic abuse mentality. Yet I see her being touted by some as &quot;strong and independent&quot;. It&apos;s this kind of ignorant trash that sets feminism back decades. Women who defend this book are, however unwittingly, participating in some of the most blatant misogyny I&apos;ve ever witnessed, giving the impression that some women enjoy being debased, abused, and controlled (outside of a consensual Dom/sub relationship). This is not a book about BDSM, this is a book about one sick, abusive man and his obsession with a young, naive invertebrate. It&apos;s a book about a girl who has absolutely no sense of self, who sacrifices any pretense of individuality in order to hold onto a man who doesn&apos;t even show her the faintest glimmer of respect. It&apos;s about two attention-starved individuals with the emotional maturity of toilet paper convincing themselves that their relationship is &apos;like, the best thing ever, OMG&apos;. It&apos;s trite, insulting, and dangerous. I fear for any impressionable young women who read this and think that this is how an ideal relationship should operate. If nothing else, it should be issued as a guidebook to mothers around the world to show their daughters the kind of man to avoid at all costs. This book does good men (and indeed, all of humanity) a disservice. 
  
*Sigh*A bestseller. They&apos;re thinking of turning it into a movie....I can&apos;t....

Thanks for taking one for the team!&quot;Thanks, Yads:) I&apos;ll probably add more to this over the next couple of days if/as I think of it. There was just so damn much to complain about. I really do not understand the hype. The erotic factor can be found in a lot of other books, and I&apos;m sure at least some of those are a lot better written. I think the only reason it&apos;s so hyped is because it started out as Twilight fanfic. That&apos;s the only way I can see its popularity making any sense.

I really hope that&apos;s wrong.

Lol.
    
  
        
      I do not recall the finger sucking...(was I THAT drunk?.....and yes, I did read that book while drinking. Not recommended, btw! You get suicidal.)I do recall him being turned on by the kid sucking his mother boobs. Still weird for me.The wtf moments that I can think of right now are:*The fact that when C had Anna problems he went to the lady that initiated him to bdsm- a lady that is about 30 years older than him. They talked, no cheating, mind you!Still, talking about your gf/wife with somebody that pretty much was a pedophile (she liked him since he was 16…do not remember if she waited for him to be 18 before she jumped his bones….) and molded you in to the twisted obsessive fucker that you are.*That all his ex-es look alike. Like, carbon copies. Why? Because he likes his sex partners to look like his biological mother. And no….I am not kidding.Still, it is said that Anna is special. I have no idea why….she is the most boring of the lot of them.*He pays school/housing/what ever-you name it for all of his ex gf. Every single on of them. And the one that tried to kill Anna? She gets psychiatric help. Because she did not really mean it.*The girl that ended up at the shrinks? I do not really remember what book that was in (her being in their flat and brandishing a knife) but Chris did the most logical thing he could- he took her clothes off and put her in a tub while holding her. Clothed, mind you.Why, you ask?Only he knows.Btw,I read an interview with this author once…She states that she never researched bdsm. She said that she knows ONE man in the bdsm genre. She met him and thought ‘Wow! He is even more fu*ked up that my male character!’. She then proceeds to tell how she knows all people in the lifestyle are….weird psychos. But she understands that they also have to live! That is why she gave Chris a HEA. Even the weirdoes get those!I am very much not in to bdsm, but I feel totally offended. Bearing this in mind, I implore you- check out how she skims the bdsm. There will be more of the ‘bdsm’ in the 2 and third book - so pay attention. See how she knows not a thing about what she is writing. *shakes her head*

People don&apos;t generally take kindly to pedophilia...*smdh*Yeah, the Mrs. Robinson who seduced him when he was 15....no, she didn&apos;t wait until he was 18. Which makes her a pedophile. Something that greatly irked me in the first book was that Christian kept saying, &quot;She&apos;s not a pedophile!&quot; Ummm...yeah, Chris, she is. I&apos;ve read so many reviews that I&apos;ve probably spoiled all the surprises for myself. I&apos;d already heard about the &quot;all his subs look like his birth mother&quot; thing, and I was thoroughly disgusted. Last time I checked, serial killers do that kind of thing. Hmm.It&apos;s very offensive. I&apos;ve participated in some very light BDSM (Vanilla BDSM? lol)....and to say that everyone who has a particular kink is somehow &quot;fucked up&quot;? Can you imagine what a bore E.L. James must be in the sack? Ha!
    
  
        
      I read those books at the time they came out. So I forgot….mostly everything. With the sheer power of my will. ^^I checked now. The bath scene was also in book one, so eh! You have already been there! :DDD(Btw, was that not the strangest thing EVER?)As for sexing him up when he was 16……..riiight. There was talk about him being 18 for…something…I have it all mixed up.(God…my memory is like the memory of a hamster- from meal to meal..)Because this shit was not fun. It actually made me mad. Madder still when I read the above mentioned interview. I mean, if a book is bad, I am at least supposed to have fun with it, no?Along the lines of this  weird erotic book ^^
    
  
        
      Btw, I actually went and fount my FSoG book 3...yeah, he licks his kids fingers. It was not sexual, so I Idid not connect the dots for what you were talking about....still, it was very much weird.

I think there may have been something wrong with the efile of the first book I got a hold of. No bath scene for me, no appearance of any old flames of Christian&apos;s at all, which I found odd....and the quotes from Tess of the D&apos;Urbervilles were missing. Might have to remedy this. I agree, it wasn&apos;t fun at all. When reading erotic scenes, the usual reaction is arousal, not laughing/horrified/disgusted/confused/yawning. Lol.That. That book. Sex with a Mummy? I might have to try and get my hands on that. Lol.

Even skimming through this book is painful, lol. You would probably have to read this book four or five times to pick up every mistake. 
  &quot;You wanted to know why I felt so confused after you - which euphemism should we apply - spanked, punished, beat, assaulted me.&quot;
&quot;Tanned my hide&quot; would be a euphemism. &quot;Assaulted me&quot;, not so much.

      Another awesome review. You need your own website. I&apos;m not just saying that &apos;cause you&apos;re my sister and all. I think it was funnier because I had already read the book, and yes, there were a great many things that disturbed me as well. Like her consistently disregarding her roommate/best friend&apos;s instincts. She doesn&apos;t trust the man FOR A REASON and it ain&apos;t jealousy! I don&apos;t think I would object so much to this book if it was presented in a such a way to show that Ana has serious self-esteem, psychological issues and actually woke up and got help. Or even it showed this &quot;relationship&quot; following its logical conclusion to him beating the hell out of her cuz that&apos;s where it&apos;s headed. As you so rightly pointed out, this kind of &quot;fiction&quot; is doing a huge disservice to women out there that need a very different message. It makes me really sad to think there are many women that truly believe that they have to act this way in order to be loved.

Had this been presented realistically with, as you say, the girl coming to her senses and leaving the bastard, or him finally beating the shit out of her, I could somewhat overlook the bad writing. But this entire series is spiraling down into Redemptionville, and all I can do is shake my head and weep for the future. I&apos;ve actually seen people freaking out on those of us who don&apos;t like this book by saying we need to read the entire series to really &quot;get it&quot;. Since she left the sicko at the end of the first book, I would have been much happier had it just ended there. The fact that they get back together only about 10% into the second book only infuriates me further.

    Introducing an even more abusive and disturbing TWILIGHT! Now with whips and chains!
  

  

  Fifty Shades of Shit
Haters, please exit stage left.I&apos;m not sure what possessed me to pick up Fifty Shades of Grey. I thought I might genuinely like it before I started, but all I was left with was one hell of a mindfuck. Whatever it was that brought on this knee jerk purchase seems to have mercifully left me with enough common sense to say I will not be continuing on with this series.Recently I discovered one of my favorite publishers, Random House, has picked up Fifty Shades of Grey and made this statement:&quot;An orig­i­nal work, and said to us that James had war­ranted the books were, indeed orig­i­nal. Mes­sitte added she was “aware of the nar­ra­tive that [50 SHADES] started as dif­fer­ently titled piece of fic­tion, but that they were and are two dis­tinctly sep­a­rate pieces of work.&quot;I&apos;m sorry, but I&apos;m going to have to call bull shit on that. Fifty Shades of Grey and Master of the Universe (the original fan fic) are essentially the same thing. The biggest difference being Edward and Bella&apos;s name being replaced with Christian and Anastasia respectively. And I would know this because I have both and while I was reading, I would occasionally switch back and forth between the two without difficulty. I&apos;d go through and give you examples myself, but other people have done it already here and here. So if you must read this book, do yourself a solid and find the fan fic online. You even get the second book too!I know some people claim this has no similarities to Twilight and got dammit, I&apos;m allergic to all the bull shit. Do I really need to point this all out? Because it looks pretty obvious to me. The mannerisms of the characters are exactly the same. They even say similar things the original characters say. The whole &quot;dazzle&quot; line and Edward asking Bella to trust him. Her mother being remarried with the same inability to maneuver her way around a kitchen. Bella is still trying to save Edward from himself due to his troubled past. Edward still stalks and controls Bella, only now he gets to hit her when she gets out of line.*facepalm* Shall I beat them both? Yes?I struggled to come up with a proper review for this book and couldn&apos;t figure out why I was feeling rather uninspired to write one. And then I figured it out. I was left so disgusted by this book that I wanted to purge the memory of its existence from my mind. With a rusty nail. Every time I thought of the book my brain cells would go on strike, yelling obscenities at me.  Anyway, I thought Bella and Edward&apos;s relationship couldn&apos;t get anymore fucked up than Twilight. I stand corrected. If I were to describe FSoG in one sentence it would be this: Fifty Shades of Grey is like Twilight on steroids, high on ecstasy, in a dirty little corner. A very dirty corner. With badly written sex. Lots.Sexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsex....oh......sexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsex...Fifty Shades of Grey tells the story of the beautiful (but of course she doesn&apos;t know it), naive virgin, Anastasia Steal after she is suckered into interviewing the Greek god, Christian Grey. Of course, sparks fly and for some unknown reason he can&apos;t seem to stay away from this incredibly, unremarkable girl.  Ana discovers Christian is into BDSM and desires her as his submissive fuck buddy.There are a myriad of problems with this novel, many of which ironically can be found in Twilight. Never saw that one coming! Christian/Edward is still a controlling bastard, only now he hides behind his BDSM practices to camouflage his abusive tendencies. However, Ana doesn&apos;t see it that way. She thinks of him as a broken person and it&apos;s her duty to fix him. Even when he says things like this:&quot;I want to hurt you. But not beyond anything you couldn&apos;t take.&quot;Can you believe she let&apos;s him beat her after that? And please don&apos;t even bother to tell me that it&apos;s just BDSM. No, just fucking no. Ana is genuinely afraid of Christian and is never entirely comfortable with the &quot;punishment&quot; aspect of their relationship. But Christian just manipulates her with sex to continue the relationship. And that&apos;s what really gets me. I just have a hard time believing a virgin would somehow become a sex goddess overnight, because that is exactly what happens. When she first is introduced to his kinky lifestyle and tells him she is a virgin he immediately tells her he needs to handle that &quot;situation&quot; before they could continue. What?! Since when is your virginity a &quot;situation?&quot; But, that&apos;s not really the kicker. Oh, no, because that is when we are introduced to Ana&apos;s two best friends. Everyone say hi to:
  
Sexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsex....oh......sexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsex...Anna&apos;s inner goddess, who always cheers her on when Christian wants sex or wants to punish her. She&apos;s also quite annoying, doing back flips at the mention of anything sexual related. Simmer down. Where did she come from exactly? Ana is in her twenties and has never felt the urge to have sex with anyone until Christian comes along with his whips and chains?!And... Ana&apos;s sub-conscious, who hides behind couches when it comes time for her beating. When it comes to Ana having sex with Christian, well, her sub-conscious only has one thing to say,
  
So after the &quot;situation&quot; is handled, Ana has to sign a &quot;contract&quot; agreeing to his sexual demands and also outlining things she won&apos;t do. It was pretty pointless considering he still got what he wanted and she never signed the damn thing. He exploits her, stalks her and abuses her! She cries after sex. She is afraid of him being angry! Even when he is angry at something else, she thinks it&apos;s her. Her reasoning for allowing him to hit her as his therapy is because she&apos;s afraid to lose him. That is not a reason for agreeing to a BDSM lifestyle! In fact, that&apos;s not even really &quot;consent!&quot; These quotes just scream domestic abuse to me:&quot;Please don&apos;t be angry with me,&quot; I whisper.&quot;Please don&apos;t hit me,&quot; I whisper, pleading.His brow furrows, his eyes widening. He blinks twice.&quot;I don&apos;t want you to spank me. Not here. Not now. Please don&apos;t.&quot;Yeah, he&apos;s a real catch, that one. Barf. No, excuse me. That&apos;s not right. The barfing came when the little ass-wipe PULLED HER TAMPON OUT AND RAMMED HIMSELF INSIDE OF HER. OMFG. Yes, the caps were totally necessary because that was the most disgusting thing I have ever had the misfortune of reading. That is not sexy, that&apos;s foul.Whenever Ana thinks about leaving him, he comes over to her apartment unannounced pounds into her (literally) and her inner goddess does a fucking happy dance, forgetting her urge to kick his sick ass to the curb. They fight, they breakup. They kiss, they sex up.Sexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsex....oh......sexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsex...Christian: &quot;Do you still want me gone Ana?&quot;Inner goddess: *growl*Sub-conscious: ...
  
Dance, puppet. Dance.The writing is a shitty mess too. I mean, if I had to sit and read Ana saying &quot;Holy, shit!&quot; or &quot;Holy, Fuck!&quot; or &quot;Oh, my!&quot; one more time, I was going to lose it. I wanted to take my red pen and have at this &quot;book&quot; so badly. It was the little things like Ana&apos;s roommate saying over and over, &quot;You never cry Ana,&quot; and what do we find Ana always doing? Crying. I&apos;m not sure where the hell the plot was. *smacks forehead* How silly of me! Didn&apos;t I mention this was a Twilight retelling? Why was I expecting a plot? And another example of poor writing: for these characters to be American, they sounded very British to me. They used phrases that Americans don&apos;t use.And now I&apos;m trying to figure out why this book is so popular. Why do so many women love this book? I get the appeal of the bondage even though it&apos;s not my usual cup of tea. Whips? Chains? Sounds exciting!Sexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsex....oh......sexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsex...
  
Abuse? Not so much.Fuck my life! Zero stars!Eh, I&apos;m off to read a good book now and possibly to bleach my brain.More reviews at Cuddlebuggery Book Blog.
         
        
      Or you could google Master of the Universe and search and replace the names of Bella and Edward with Anastasia and Christian. It&apos;s what the author did.

      It reminds me of Clare to the T. You can&apos;t even bring up her past anymore. Try putting it on the Wiki page and they&apos;ll delete your account. It&apos;s really pathetic how they try and hide things that aren&apos;t exactly a secret. I knew this was a fan-fic, but after hearing it&apos;s being published by Random House, I need to check this out. Don&apos;t worry about the high jacking! It&apos;s totally fine with me. :)

      Hah, that&apos;s why I held back on my last response I saw us completely taking over going back and forth. God, I want so badly to boycott Random House now. This is all entirely unacceptable.
    
  
        
      I really don&apos;t understand how anyone could justify selling fan-fic. Smh.
    
  
        
      If it worked with Clare then why not try it again? You know how crazy popular she is.
    
  
        
      It&apos;s abhorrent. I&apos;m offended for all authors who bother to write their own characters and plots.With Clare, didn&apos;t she at least rewrite hers? (I really don&apos;t know, I&apos;ve seen everything from &apos;it&apos;s the same&apos; to &apos;she just used the themes.&apos;) I don&apos;t think rewriting it is justification either (I&apos;m unyielding like that), but it&apos;s still much better than doing a simple name/physical description change. (Well, and I guess they got rid of a million ellipses, still about three million left though.)
    
  
        
      I&apos;ve heard that passages are nearly verbatim, particularly the beginning.

But in any case she had to change things up since she *did* plagiarize dialogue and descriptions from TV shows and other books. I didn&apos;t read her original fan-fic, but someone has a review on GRs talking about the similarities between them.
    
  
        
      It&apos;s the original plagiarism that turned me off of her novels, but someone told me if I&apos;d read Draco Veritas I&apos;d read the books. Don&apos;t know how accurate that is since I won&apos;t read them.
    
  
        
      And I hear it&apos;s hard to find the original fan fic online. I haven&apos;t tried to search it out because it&apos;s longer than the entire Harry Potter series. So if you think about it, Clare has quite a bit of material to work with.

I think it&apos;s Palice&apos;s review that had shown a direct passage from both texts, and they were exactly the same.
    
  
        
      When the plagiarism came out it was removed from most of the reputable fanfiction sites. I think when she got a publishing contract she tried to make it disappear further. I think you have to know someone who has downloaded it to find it. I wonder if illegal download sites would have it?
    
  
        
      No clue, but it was Palice&apos;s review that showed a passage rip: http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/.... As far as Fifty Shades of Gray goes, I&apos;m curious to see what the hubbub is about.
    
  
        
      Sigh. Dammit. That is so disgusting. I&apos;ve never tried to go looking for the fics. I&apos;m not interested in reading her stuff in the first place, thankfully.MOTU will never disappear from the Internet, because if it does I&apos;ll start putting it up in places.

They&apos;re even still in Seattle, which was the dumbest thing to leave them there, not just because of the setting similarity to Twilight but since they sound British, why not just move them there? Duh. But if you look at the side by side comparison Rameau commented with it&apos;s just minor editing fixes (so to speak). I think she changed Bella&apos;s school, still don&apos;t know if either exists. Stuff like that.

      Wow. I read a while back about Cassandra Clare ripping stuff off from Buffy, but I never knew the full extent of it. I already am not super into her MI series, but I was going to pick up the next book in it just cause it&apos;s a decent read..Probably not anymore! That&apos;s really disappointing on both authors here, and I don&apos;t understand how this is acceptable ://Thanks for the enlightenment.

It&apos;s mostly an ebook. So they cost a lot to print in such small increments? That&apos;s my best guess.

      I guess I live under a really big rock, because I had no idea about Fifty, and only a tiny idea about Clare. I had read 3 of the books a while back (I automatically give 3 stars to books I read forever ago and dont remember), but now I&apos;m feeling pretty dumb for it.

      That link... I can barely believe it. Please tell me it&apos;s the same author that just decided to change the names and publish it.Still, Twilight fanfiction *grimace*
    
  
        
      Hey Random but have you read any of the Masters of the Shadowlands by Cherise Sinclair? I am hooked on them. By the way, Twilight was great but we only need one. Lol
    
  
      Mmmmh... I read them so... hungrily, feverishly I guess would be and apt description. The saga was so addictive. Like drug, not good but undropable, and the haze felt good. And then you get the cold turkey and you can&apos;t believe you didn&apos;t notice the guy was a real creep and the gal a maniac wimp right away.The bad part of Twilight fan fiction is that they are all the bad without any of the feel good haze. I&apos;ve read some pretty good fiction based on other works. It&apos;s just crappy fics are like a general malaise for Twilight. Or maybe it&apos;s just a very bad case of Sturgeon&apos;s Law. In any case, I&apos;m not drinking from that pool.
    
  
        
      Seems like this one is a cross between Twilight and that old James Spader movie, Secretary. The combination of the two makes me shake my head.
    
  
      Lol lol lol. I thought the same reading the blurb! Except knowing the base twifan, I bet it&apos;s a very watered, vanilla, silly version, the more to confound you about the true issues.

Oh really?&quot;He walked to the door of the restaurant and held it open with an obstinate expression. Obviously, there would be no further discussion.&quot; Uhm, &apos;kay?&quot;Drink,&quot; he ordered. I sipped at my soda obediently, and then drank more deeply, surprised by how thirsty I was. I realized I had finished the whole thing when he pushed his glass toward me. WTF? Is this like the movie Secretary where she realizes she&apos;s totally into being a sub?This is why when people try to argue that this fic is in any way original and divorced from Twilight I side-eye them so hard. There are a ton of BDSM Twifics, and MOTU wasn&apos;t even close to the first. It&apos;s not coincidental.
    
  
        
      LOL, Alicia. You know, I never thought of comparing the actual Twilight to the Secretary, but you&apos;re totally right. It&apos;s sort of funny though in hindsight considering that the librarians at my library (which is ultra conservative) recommend Twilight to teens because of it&apos;s apparently chaste message. I seriously saw an eight year old&apos;s mother getting her a copy of Eclipse and Lauren Kate&apos;s Torment the other day there and it just made me shake my head.
    
  
        
      I hate when people say Twilight has a chaste message. I feel like they read an entirely different book than I did. Edward&apos;s concern for their ~virtue was brought up after he couldn&apos;t convince her that he&apos;d kill her. And after he used sex as leverage for marriage. She made it clear she didn&apos;t want to get married, especially so young, but she wanted the sex so badly (and transformation) she bartered marriage to get both. So the message becomes &apos;don&apos;t have sex before marriage kids, but getting married at 18 solely to get what you want – sex – is a-okay!&apos;How is that chaste?

           In the words of Miss Steele, &quot;You need to sort your shit out, Grey!&quot; Good day, sir! Fifty Shades of Grey, more like Fifty shades of fucked up nonsense *rolls eyes* I should get a medal for just finishing this tripe. I honestly do NOT feel like revisiting this book and writing a review. I’d rather spend the time searching for ways to remove this utter nonsense from my memory. However, this book is so bad that I feel the need to warn others from this drivel. Luckily, I did not buy this garbage. I do not even know what overcame me to read it and I can only blame a momentary lack of judgment on my part.What baffles me is the scary fangirlgasm following this book. So what’s causing it a hit? I can only come up with ‘twilight’. Doing some research, this book was originally posted online as a twilight fanfic! Yes, a twilight fanfic. The fact that this book’s source material isn’t a good piece of literature just shows what you should expect from this book. And dubbing it a twilight fanfic and promoting it as such is no doubt raising the bar on the sale figures. What has the world come to? *headdesk* Whatever’s causing its success; I can safely say it can’t be the book itself.Everything you could possibly imagine is wrong with this book! The execution and the characters. And the writing. And the plot (wait, was there one?!?) Firstly, it has been said a countless number of times how abusive Bella and Edward’s relationship was. And it is arguably the most anti-feminist portrayal of any relationship. FSoG simply continues this unhealthy view and promotes an even more abusive and degrading relationship towards women, targeting older women (and possibly even teenage girls who know no better). Oh dear god, I hope teenage girls do not jump on this disturbing bandwagon. Surely, it is degrading to ask a woman to sign a contract where ‘she is now the property of the Dominant, to be dealt with as the Dominant pleases’ and ‘submitting [herself] to any sexual activity demanded by the Dominant…without hesitation or argument’ – especially when you take into consideration the fact that she would be signing up to something she has not yet experienced and knows little about as she is still a virgin. This is not something that should be promoted as desirable or idealistic. This book cheapens what feminists have fought for years! Don’t get me wrong I wouldn&apos;t deprive women of their right to express themselves sexually, nor to act upon their desires but I shudder at the thought of women aspiring to a relationship where she will take part in various things that she is not comfortable with and at times, even when she’s genuinely in fear of taking part, simply because she finds the guy ‘hot’.The plot - I’m not even sure if there was one. 50% of the book is spent talking about sex/the contract and the other 50% is made up of clumsily written sex scenes. (view spoiler)[FSoG starts of with Anastasia Steele agreeing to interview the billionaire, Christian Grey. Miss Steele is instantly captivated by Mr Grey’s dashing looks and within 2 days she falls in love with him. Mr Grey for some unfathomable reason can’t keep away from her and reveals to her his secret kinky lifestyle. The two spend the rest of the romantic evening calmly discussing the contract that allows him to fuck her senseless. She reveals to him that she’s a virgin and his only response, he needs to handle that ‘situation’. Really?!? The next 4 days, he gets to do exactly what he wants, he stalks her, abuses her and punishes her by spanking her several times. Quotes that spring to mind – “Please don’t hit me…don’t be angry with me…don’t want you to spank me” Aww, isn’t that romantic? Atleast, she finally sees some sense and walks out.  (hide spoiler)]The writing is dull and unimaginative. It reads more like a diary – he did this, I did this. The constant repetitions are enough to make someone suicidal! I hope I never have to see the words, ‘my subconscious’ and ‘my inner goddess’ ever again or so help me god! The sex scenes were terrible and frankly a little disturbing to put down on paper – an incident with the tampon springs to mind.The characters are simply absurd in this book. AnaBella SteeleSwan Anastasia Steele irked me quite a lot and reading this book from her point of view was no picnic in the park. Finding out that she is 21 years old was a shock – she reads like a dim-witted 12 year old, who’s vocabulary doesn’t extend further from ‘jeez’, ‘oh crap’, ‘damn’, ‘oh my’, ‘holy cow’ and even the constant reference to her vagina as ‘down there’. I found nothing remotely interesting about her. She has most of Bella’s traits and then some – she’s boring, clumsy and downright bitter, even towards her best friend, Kate. The only other word I can use to describe her is a ‘scrounger’ – can’t she afford her own clothes? She’s too gullible and a hypocrite. She’s weak-willed and succumbs so easily for my liking. And I’m pretty sure she suffers from some form of mental disorder – schizophrenia perhaps? She constantly refers to what she calls her ‘inner goddess’ and her ‘subconscious’, who either cheer her on when there’s an opportunity for sex or take opportunities to call her a ‘dirty hoe’!(view spoiler)[ “My subconscious asks me, her eyebrow figuratively raised…My subconscious is metaphorically screaming at me, arms folded, leaning on one leg and tapping her foot in frustration…My subconscious is figuratively tutting and glaring at me over her half moon specs…My subconscious - she’s doing her happy dance in a bright red hula skirt…______________________________________________My inner goddess glares at me, tapping her small foot impatientlyMy inner goddess is doing the merengue with some salsa movesMy inner goddess is lying on, eating grapes and tapping her fingers,My inner goddess is spinning like a world-class ballerina, pirouette after pirouetteMy inner goddess jumps up and down with cheerleading pom-poms, is doing back flips in a routine worthy of a Russian Olympic gymnast, is standing on the podium awaiting her gold medal, has back flipped off the podium and is doing cartwheels around the stadium, bounces up and down like a small child waiting for ice cream, looks like someone snatched her ice cream. My inner goddess is not pleased”  (hide spoiler)] Kill me now!I swear Kate was a much more interesting character and would have made a better female lead, but like the other few characters she was mentioned only for the sake of a story. A real shame.Christian Grey…where do I begin?______________________________________________From: KrutiSubject: Your issuesDate: April 18 2011 23:15To: Christian GreyDear Mr Grey,You sir, are a pompous asshole! And frankly, you are in need of much help. Perhaps, I can direct you to the nearest mental hospital? Or better yet, accompany you to the nearest police station? It&apos;s the least I can do.In response to your email, I think you have that the wrong way around, sir. It is I who would like to hurt you til you’re fifty shades of red!Laters, baby.KrutiOn Apr 18, 2012 at 23:00 PM, Christian Grey (christiangrey@ihaveissues.com) wrote:&quot;I want to hurt you. But not beyond anything you couldn&apos;t take.&quot;Christian GreyCEO, Grey Enterprises Holdings Inc._____________________________________________There are simply so many things wrong with his character that I don’t even know where to begin. What’s unacceptable is how his upbringing is used as an excuse to cover up his abusive tendencies. NO!! That does not give him the right to exert control over her and abuse her. Ana constantly tells him how uncomfortable and afraid she is with what he wants and all he can say is &apos;That’s a Dom/sub thing. You’ll get used to it.&apos;. Hell NO! That&apos;s not BDSM. Okay children, let&apos;s explore the definition of BDSM: &quot;form of personal relationship involving the consensual use of restraint..&quot; Consensual being the key word! Don&apos;t tell me we have two consenting adults here. No, Ana is just a child trapped in a woman&apos;s body. She has no true idea of what this lifestyle entails and is at most times in fear.If you&apos;re still not convinced about how unhealthy this relationship was, this probably will convince you. To ensure he gets her to do what he wants, he manipulates her with promises of a relationship if she is willing to try his way of lifestyle. And, Ana being the fool she is lets him beat her thinking &apos;Oh my, holy cow he&apos;s hot&apos; and &apos;It’s what he wants...after all he’s done, I have to man up and take whatever he decides he wants, whatever he thinks he needs&apos;. So in her mind, his need to control her and beat her is a form of therapy? No! That&apos;s not BDSM either.I have absolutely nothing more to add. I&apos;m taking my inner goddess elsewhere and grabbing a good book.Extras: Honestly this is what I imagined Christian to be like.

Abusive relationships is where i have to draw the line. What&apos;s worrying is that books that promote abusive relationships are published en masse and will be made into a movies too. This type of book is not something you would want people (especially young minds) to be gushing over and wishing they had.

Can you believe after writing this the author is now the 100 most influential people in the world according to Time? The only way I can see her being influential is in changing the world for the worse.

That he was abusive and creepy to boot doesn&apos;t seem to matter, because Oh Em Gee it&apos;s Edward!

For someone who&apos;s depicted as being a strong, independent child who spent her childhood looking after her mother and now her father, she really does let Edward dictate to her. And Edward, well, I made up my mind about him the moment he was thinking about bringing an oilcan with him the next time he was going to stalk Bella so her windows don&apos;t creak.

And if you do decide to read the story, please consider finding a residual copy of fanfiction free online instead of paying 10$ a book.

And I agree that reading one review shouldn&apos;t cause the kind distress Sarai expressed. What I don&apos;t agree with is what your previous comment, intentionally or not, implied: That not liking this book meant not understanding it.

           Garbage. Absolutely horrifying, utter trash. A waste of trees, bookshelf space and precious, oh so very fucking precious braincells. Honestly, why is this even published? Every single book store in Sydney is promoting this tripe, claiming it to be some kind of awesome romance novel. Are you absolutely shitting me? There is nothing romantic at all about this &apos;book&apos;. And I don&apos;t mean the BDSM erotica themes, I mean the fifty levels of abuse in this friggin&apos; thing. In fact, that&apos;s what this book should be called. &apos;Fifty shades of absolute-fucking-insanity-and-abuse&apos;. I know at least every one star reviewer has taken the title and created their own pun with it, but fuck it, I&apos;m jumping on the bandwagon too. Before I decided to read this (God help me), I kept seeing it everywhere I went, and the book store where I work was involved in the promotion among other book store chains. Typical. All me and my co-workers knew that it was smut, and a hell of a lot of it too. We even turned the book into a drinking game, and it goes as thus: Flip to a random page of the book. If it&apos;s something dirty, take a drink. I do not recommend this game, for one could die from alcohol poisoning within the first round. But if you&apos;re feeling adventurous... by all means. Glad I could be of service to your crazy party ideas. But anyway, let&apos;s cut to my opinion of this abomination of literature. I decided to read it because it sounded like garbage, and I haven&apos;t written a review about garbage in too long. I owed something to the people who actually found me worthwhile to follow on Goodreads. So I decided hell, I&apos;ll review this. Brain cells I will never, ever, EVER, get back.This is literally the worst book I have ever read, and I say that about many books. But this is the worst book for a damn good reason. Let&apos;s talk about what I hated about this book. The bottom line is I hated absolutely everything. And I&apos;m not saying that to be funny, I&apos;m saying that out of all seriousness. I didn&apos;t find a single redeeming quality in this book. With the Hush, hush series we at least had the unintentional hilarity and the awesomeness of Marcie. In Twilight we had that chick who wanted to kill Bella and Tyler&apos;s van. Fifty shades of Grey has no such redeeming qualities. The characters are bland and merely props to set the stage for fucking weird BDSM-ing, and the plot was lost somewhere in the vagina of the author&apos;s wet dream. (Believe me, I feel weird for even typing these words.) Not to mention, even though everyone already knows this, this was originally a Twilight fan fiction called &apos;Master of the universe&apos; or some shitty, stupid title like that. How did such a thing get published? What, Twilight wasn&apos;t horrible and abuse-glorifying enough, so we had to kick it up a notch with publishing &apos;Master of the universe&apos;? Are you people serious? Why is it that dumber and dumber things are getting published? Quality is almost non-existent. Fucking hell. But before I rant on for hours about that, let&apos;s talk about the characters. Oh, I mean props. Yeah, props is more appropriate. Why? Because the characters, for all the personality they had may as well have been props. Our first main prop is Ana, aka Bella Swan. The plain, virginal wallflower who thinks lowly of herself whilst everyone around her just seems to freaking worship her. She is also clumsy, reads books, has divorced parents, doesn&apos;t get along with her step-father, and is a brain dead moronic twat. Remind you of anyone? I wonder who you&apos;re thinking of. That is a humdinger, isn&apos;t it? I&apos;m amazed how many women are not pissed off with her complete lack of sense and self-respect. She lets a man abuse her physically and emotionally, and allows him to satiate his ever-growing need to control her completely, passing it off as some cute obsessive habit. And even if she has doubts and runs away, she comes running back to him only seconds after. How are people not pissed off about this? Seriously? Not to mention she has zero personality, zero brain-cells, and zero common sense. Her character serves no purpose other than becoming some abusive asshole&apos;s sex toy. And let&apos;s not forget our second main prop, Christian Grey, aka Edward Cullen, aka creepy-stalker-sociopathic-megalomaniacal-abusive-horrifying-asshole. The fact that he has fangirls in the real world has pretty much ruined my faith in mankind, and the new generation. Christian Gray pretty much pushes the limits that Edward Cullen, Patch, Daniel and others have yet to push due to their PG ratings, but fuck does Christian Grey push those fucking limits. He physically abuses Ana, and it somehow gets excused on the account that she was briefly aroused by it. SERIOUSLY PEOPLE?? SERIOUSLY?? Fuck my life. He also decides what she should eat, what she should wear, how she should act, speak, communicate with him, where she can and can&apos;t go or what she can and can&apos;t do, threatens her constantly even with physical violence, and the list goes on. I kid you not. He even has this set out as a contract (which by the way is repeated at least 5 times in the fucking book). Here&apos;s another example of how romantic this mother fucker is:&quot;I like the control it gives me, Anastasia. I want you to behave in a particular way, and if you don&apos;t, I shall punish you, and you will learn to behave the way I desire.&quot;See? Romantic as freaking Mel Gibson. And by the way, the women who find this guy romantic need some serious therapy. Seriously. Harsh I know, but finding this guy romantic is like like excusing the actions of a child-molester because he has nice hair. This is not romantic. This is ABUSIVE and WRONG on sooooo many levels.I don&apos;t know why they decided to plant this book in the general romance section. This is not romantic. And don&apos;t give me the &apos;IT&apos;S MEANT TO BE BDSM, SO IT&apos;S SUPPOSED TO BE ALL DOM VS SUB&apos;. This goes way beyond the good ol&apos; BDSM theme and just ends up treading into abusive territory. Christian takes these aspects into the relationship where he ends up not only controlling a woman sexually, but also emotionally, and deliberately moulding her into not just a sex partner, but an ideal of what he wants her to be and leaves her no room for her individuality and instead brands it as &apos;punishable&apos;. That&apos;s not part of the BDSM jig. I&apos;m sorry, but it&apos;s not. Why people even call this romantic is beyond me. I already mentioned the abusive aspects of this so called relationship, but other than that it was a relationship built on air. Since neither of the characters had any personality outside their sex drives, they had nothing that they saw in each other. They couldn&apos;t relate to each other, they didn&apos;t share any common interests, they didn&apos;t do any good for each other, outside the sexy stuff. And at the end they want to pass it off as though the two are actually in love? Give me a break. Watching people get swooped at by magpies is more romantic that this garbage.The plot? There was no plot. Seriously, I could not find it. ANYWHERE. I searched and searched but alas, my search has left me unrewarded. Let me explain in a quick paragraph how this book goes:&apos;Girl meets some guy. Some guy is hot. Girl thinks some guy is hot. Hot some-guy shows up where girl who thinks some-guy is hot works. Hot some-guy asks out girl, takes her virginity. Stuff happens. Hot some-guy introduces girl (who thinks he&apos;s hot, by the way) to his BDSM sex dungeon, and the next half of the book is spent pondering whether or not girl (who thinks some-guy is hot, in case it wasn&apos;t mentioned enough in the book) wants to indulge in hot some-guy&apos;s fantasies. Also the hot some-guy takes complete control over girl (did I mention she thinks he&apos;s hot?) who seems to be totally okay with it. More stuff happens. Girl gets spanked too hard, breaks up with hot some-guy. The end.&apos;That&apos;s it. That&apos;s the whole book. And the whole &apos;Ohhh Christian has secrets&apos; bullcrap in the blurb? Bullcrap. His secrets are mentioned in only 5% of the book and drive the plot nowhere. The book is only about how some asshole wants to control some stupid girl. The other characters are barely relevant. They were just more props whose only role was to be interested in the &apos;relationship&apos; between Ana and Christian. They didn&apos;t seem to be interested in anything else. They could be buttering toast and thinking &apos;I wonder how hard Christian is fucking Ana right now.&apos;An absolute waste. The media might be promoting this tripe as the new hero of literature, but this is and always will be just another wart on the ass of literature, along with Twilight and all its&apos; descendants. You know what they say, you can polish a turd, but it will still be a turd.

      Turd, indeed.I skipped over the paragraph which summarises the book because I still have a way to go yet. I can&apos;t believe I am actually worried about spoilers for this book.I think this review sums up my thoughts quite adequately. I love the point you make about FSoG transcending the boundaries of Patch and Edward etc....that&apos;s very true. But...at least he doesn&apos;t sparkle, right? Or does he?!So........onto the sequel now? ;)
    
  
        
      No. NO. NOOOOOOO. NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!! No more of this torture! I WILL NOT HAVE IT!! I swear if there are spin-offs, I&apos;m gonna... be even more pissed.Speaking of the sequel, it&apos;s fucking ridden with 5 star reviews!! What is this world coming to? By the way, the people who are fawning over Christian Grey, you&apos;re all fucking creepy.
    
  
        
      You know you want to really, darling.....you know you want to....admit it! Don&apos;t you want to see how much worse this series gets? I have a theory on why books in series get higher ratings the further they go; the sequel probably has a lot of five stars because only the fanwomen girls are still continuing with the series. All the one-star readers have already given up after the first one, so there are only the fangirls to give their opinions. if that made any sense....Hah! Was that comment for all the future trolls who are bound to pounce on this review? I&apos;m not sure that&apos;s gonna do it, Lisa. They lurve a little feistyness. It only fuels them up further!
    
  
        
      That was my thought exactly! I saw all those ratings and thought to myself &apos;Either Goodreads is censoring reviews or people gave the fuck up after the first one&apos;. Unless Goodreads really is censoring reviews, which would not come as a surprise to me.
    
  
        
      *begins slow clap*Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant.
    
  
        
      We have the &quot;bunker babes&quot; to thank for how well-known this fuckery has become. Without them, this wouldn&apos;t even have been a blip on anyone&apos;s radar. Google Master of the Universe. There&apos;s all kinds of crap that happened behind the scenes... if you&apos;re bored one day.
    
  
        
      Wow. That book sounds gross. I do not want to read it. Plus I hate the idea of people telling me what to do and controlling me so MUCH!
    
  
        
      To take the bad taste out of your brain, I recommend Stay. It has a similarly controlling and abusive guy, but instead of being glamorized he is (view spoiler)[killed, violently (hide spoiler)].
    
  
        
      Great review! I still cannot believe Hollywood is attempting to make a film out of this. Honestly what else could possibly be put into the film besides them going at it? If they take out most of the sex than the film would be nothing. However, if they leave all the sex than the film would not be a film, but a porno. I for one do not go to movie theaters to watch pornos and haven&apos;t heard of anyone else who does.
    
  
        
      Thank you. THANK YOU. *Standing ovation*

      Fantastic review. Absolutely fantastic. I seriously have thought that all those glowing reviews HAD to be satire, since this book is complete poorly-written bullshit. I think there&apos;s an anthropological study in there somewhere, and the findings will be that that people who love this book are idiots.

If you do decide to read it, do it with an album playing in the background. Maybe something equally pissed off as you are as you read this tripe.

      Good review. There was a big article in our little local paper about this--book--and I&apos;m ready to scream. Why are people paying money for this??? It&apos;s still available for FREE download on places such as Epud Bud.

      I have read all three books and loved them all. Don&apos;t understand what you were hoping for when you opened the pages but it was very clear what the book was about so have no idea why you chose to read the book if the topic didn&apos;t interest you
    
  
        
      *applauds* that is all. From someone who was unfortunate enough to get the book as a birthday present recently and reading anything but, for now!* :D

      Yes, it is a waste of trees. Oh, I enjoyed the bad reviews made for this book but yeah. Poor trees.
    
  
        
      You have renewed my faith in my decision not to read this book. I don&apos;t have the time to waste with this drek
    
  
        
      I agree! Why DO women find him attractive?This book is just like porn for women; and they have NOOOOOOOOOOOOO clue why they like the book. Read the 5 star reviews, they&apos;re all nothing compared to the 1 star reviews. The 5 star don&apos;t know what they like about it but the 1 stars definitely know what they DON&apos;T like about it ;) great review
    
  
        
      Dude, I do not find controlling jerks to be sexy. I need my freedom. I would put a WASP down the pants of a man who controlled me.
    
  
        
      This review is pure gold!!

           Head&apos;s up: If any of you fuckers comment at the bottom of this review and say, &quot;You don&apos;t understand BDSM&quot; I will hunt you down and make you eat your computer, plus the mouse, plus the keyboard, plus any other internet-connected devices in your home, including but not limited to iPhones, iPods, iPads, Androids, games consoles and ereaders. This book is not an accurate or healthy portrayal of a real BDSM relationship between two consensual and enthusiastic parties. Thus, by defending it as such, you are doing a disservice to the actual culture of BDSM (no kinkshaming). So don&apos;t fuck with me and try to pull that shit.Oh, also, there will be a substantial amount of cussing throughout this review. If you care about the sanctity of your virgin eyes then shut down your computer and go do something else. We are all grown-ass adults and this is the internet. If you&apos;re going to come over and here and lecture me about swearing then I&apos;d advise that you PIPE the fuck down and stop being so bloody delicate. Alrighty, then. You guessed it, guys: it&apos;s story time.When I was thirteen, I decided I wanted to be an author. For years I&apos;d chattered away about being an architect or a vet or what have you, but who was I kidding? All I ever wanted to do was write. So I sat down, and I did. I did write.I&apos;m actually not shitting you. I thought it would be as easy as sitting down and writing some crap on Wordpad (alright, calm down, this was the noughties) and I wrote a lot of crap: I tried to write a play, and then I tried poetry, and then I wrote short stories, before eventually expanding into novels. Novels is a stretch. I wrote about a hundred single-spaced pages and to my present-day horror, made my family read it. And they actually did. Remember all those embarrassingly awful school projects you did when you were thirteen? Or even just those embarrassingly awful things you did in general when you were thirteen? I feel the same level of shame when I think of my little preteen self, handing this pile of shit over to my sister and thinking I actually had something.About a year later, with zero knowledge of how publishing works, I posted it straight into a bunch of indie publisher&apos;s slushpiles. A vanity publisher replied to me and told me they didn&apos;t want my work, and I did the undoable: I argued with them.As I write this, I&apos;m practically convulsing with embarrassment. Vanity Publisher, if you&apos;re reading this, please forget I ever existed. But if you can&apos;t do that, at least give me an alias when you tell all your friends about that dumb kid who sent you the book about pyromania without having done any research.In some ways, having read this book, I finally feel like I identify with that vanity publisher: I read someone&apos;s irredeemable shit and hated it, but then they tried to defend it and I got so mad I broke a window with my face.(Peeps, if you think E.L. James hasn&apos;t tried to defend this shit, then you need to get on YouTube and watch some pleading vids from the publisher.)I just...I haven&apos;t read a book this awful since Revealing Eden (but let&apos;s not open that can of worms). It was like an acid trip. Am I reading this, I thought? Is this actually a published book? Are people actually parting with money for this slab of steaming garbage?I feel like this book insulted me, really. I feel like it spat in my face, because what reader-respecting author would create a protagonist this redundant and awe-inspiringly dense, expecting an audience to love and respect her? It&apos;s as if someone took an ice-cream scoop and relieved Ana of her brain. How could you...? Why would you...? Why is she...?I just...I have no words. I have no words to explain this protagonist. None at all. I have more to say about the love interest, who&apos;s like a more threatening Charles Manson but with only one brainwashed follower (Ana). This guy goes to the hardware store and buys like chains and lime and shit and Ana doesn&apos;t think this is weird?What the fucking fuck?And of course there&apos;s the whole &quot;inner goddess&quot; shit and Ana thinking that it&apos;s sexy to wear a chunky knit sweater and be strapped into a vehicle, and then using the word &quot;vagina&quot; during a sex scene. &quot;Oh, he touched my vagina&quot;.Yeah, excuse me while I tame my boner!I felt so uncomfortable reading this book. Now, let&apos;s be honest here: I read porn. Of course I read porn. Anyone over sixteen who says they&apos;ve never looked at or read porn is talking out of their ass. But this book made me feel uncomfortable, and here&apos;s the kicker: I read it alone. I was reading it alone in my living room, and I felt uncomfortable inside my own head. What the fuck does that tell you?I don&apos;t want to start yammering on about the way this book is written. It&apos;s written like horrendous fanfiction. There are spelling and punctuation errors, stupid turns of phrase, random asides, stilted dialogue, awful physical descriptions, weird pacing, and I don&apos;t know, like a thousand instances of brand dropping and band-naming which gives the book this bizarre cheap and dated quality that really takes away from what little redeeming features it might have had.What are the redeeming features? I don&apos;t know. The blurb sounds interesting. That&apos;s about it.But what is it about this book that&apos;s captured the attention of so many millions of people across the world? The absurdly stupid protagonist? The pushy, obsessive, totally unrealistic love interest? The relationship in which only one party is actually interested in BDSM, and the other is incredibly resistant to it, but is forced into it? The terrible writing? The awful cover art? The cheap, thin binding? A story so convoluted, so ridiculous, so totally immature it could only ever have been born from Twilight? There is nothing enjoyable about this book. This book is garbage. There are no two ways about it: it is shit. Awful, awful shit. And I&apos;m not sorry for saying so. This is my fucking opinion, and I&apos;m damn well going to voice it. This book can kiss my ass.
         
        
      ...put the book down and back away slowly - don&apos;t show any hesitation, or it will pounce!

      These updates are hysterical! I read the books months ago and thought certain parts were WTF as well. I still liked them for entertainment value.
    
  
        
      My friend has been trying to convince me into reading this book. But I will wait for your review. MY SANITY DEPENDS ON YOUR REVIEW, KIRA. So please, help me unconvince myself.

      @Kira- It&apos;s perfectly all right. There are probably plenty of other Anastasias in the world—REAL ones, I might add—that have done admirable things I can look up to. @Nerdie- I believe most of us feel the same.
    
  
        
      I remember that meme! It seems everyone is using it now.
    
  
        
      Today someone told me how much they love this book. I laughed and said, &quot;seriously??&quot; Called my bff in another state and she said it was so horrible she couldn&apos;t finish. Thank god. Those close to me haven&apos;t lost their mind at least...

      These updates are priceless! Both your commentary as well as the atrocity that is your current reading material. What you&apos;re doing seems exhausting but I&apos;m really hoping for a glorious rant of a review.
    
  
      Your status updates are GOLD, Kira. :) I&apos;ve been cackling at them all this week on holiday, trying to push myself through the last 40% of this book. IT IS SO BAD. And yet I finished it last night!

           0 stars. DNF @55%. Review edited February 12, 2015“Sex is more than an act of pleasure, it&apos;s the ability to be able to feel so close to a person, so connected, so comfortable that it&apos;s almost breathtaking to the point you feel you can’t take it. And at this moment you&apos;re a part of them.  - Author unknown -  I&apos;ve had a rather long list of issues when I decided to abandon ship. FSoShit is garbage and if I had read a paperback I would have burned the fucking offending thing. It&apos;s a total mystery to me why this book ever saw the light of day because, let&apos;s face it, the writing is incredibly juvenile. The story and characters are extremely poorly written and I couldn&apos;t for the life of me connect with the dumb, clumsy, naïve and immature heroine. Also, the slimy whacko didn&apos;t deserve to be called hero. Christian is a highly manipulative, abusive and stalker-ish asshole. His whispers didn&apos;t endear him to me either. He came off as a total creep. I honestly don&apos;t understand what Ana saw in him, yet on the other hand, I didn&apos;t get it why Christian would stalk that bland and vapid wallflower. In any event, these two deserved each other and Ana obviously enjoyed Grey&apos;s blunt and crude approach.The whole contract business was pretty much mind-boggling. I don&apos;t believe that a healthy and consensual Dom/sub relationship could be based upon such crappy and ridiculous rules.Christian, the rich Superman (sarcasm), deflowered our wallflower in a way that&apos;s not even worthy of losing any words over that pathetic fuck. So, you did guess right. I neither found the sex to be hot nor erotic. At.All. Thus, I&apos;d better buy him a ticket to the next Mars expedition stat. That would ensure that Mr. Grey would not return to our cozy place called Mother Earth.FSoG lacked depth and emotion big time. Except of disgust and anger I felt nothing towards these pathetic main protagonists and their fucked up trip bored me to tears.The winking smileys irritated the hell outta me and all that inner goddess shit made me almost blow a fuse. Jesus.Fucking.Christ. Would you give me a break already? I&apos;ve read a variety of erotica books and I do enjoy great smexin&apos; that comes with some kind of depth and great characterization. However, I&apos;m not sorry to say that FSoG is ranking among the worst erotica books I&apos;ve ever read.What&apos;s seriously bugging me as well is the fact that the general public thinks that FSoShit provides almost every woman&apos;s erotic fantasy. I don&apos;t criticize readers who loved this book but I&apos;m criticizing the media coverage. I don&apos;t appreciate it when these people claim to know that&apos;s what a general majority of women love to read and want in real life (or in the bedroom for that matter). Seriously? Never. Ever. FSoG is bad erotica. It&apos;s bad BDSM too.  When people say FSoG is “empowering women in their sexuality,” then I think something is seriously wrong. Never ever could this story empower me in my sexuality. What in God’s name is on their minds? I can do it all by myself with my very healthy hand, and I can gladly say that my boyfriend is empowering me just fine and is taking care of my needs. Thank you very much. BTW, my boyfriend is not an abusive and manipulative stalker. Oh, yes, now it dawns on me…my boyfriend is real.Bottom line, the barely there plot and the characters were overly shallow, underdeveloped, immature and boring. The amateurish writing killed any desire to read anything else by this author in the future. And last but not least, my inner goddess was so fucking relieved when she had to quit eventually. It was a very tedious and crappy experience and I wish I had never bought this book, let alone attempted to go through this rubbish. I was in dire need of bleaching my brain.Christopher Hitchens said…

Imagine, I think she&apos;s a virgin.

      Baba, great review! I got only a short way into the story and stopped. I also thought it was poorly written and found Ana very immature, even a bit stupid. We&apos;re on the same page for this one.Btw, I keep meaning to tell you that I love your quotes at the top of your reviews. This one is particularly good.

      Awesome review, Baba. And everything that I felt about this book. The writing was awful, Ana was awful. I did like Christian though, and their connection. I ended up giving it 3 stars.

Did he pull it out or something? Or told her to? I dunno... a lot of what he did didn&apos;t really bother me at all. It was Ana and the writing that I could barely tolerate.

Her little thought bubbles are all &quot;Crap! Double crap!&quot; Got old after the first time.So I bailed. The Ammy Look Inside feature is such a blessing at times. :)

      So I read a few reviews on this book before I started it. About 7% in, Christian smiled a certain way and all I could think about was how you said he was creepy because that&apos;s exactly how I felt when I read it! LOL Had to share with you.
    
  
        
      Taryn, this was so not my book even though a lot of readers loved it. Maybe I&apos;m too old to like this story because it seems that a lot of readers who love it are very young and are fans of Twilight. I read it without knowing that the story was based on Twilight.
    
  
        
      I loved Twilight Baba, but did NOT like this book.

      I wasn&apos;t a fan of that scene either.

      I found a review that stated that this was the &apos;most erotic book you will ever read&apos;I think I snorted my coffee out my nose at that statement. That lady needs to get out a little more. I suppose nothing says &apos;erotic&apos; like dirty tampons and timid bdsm.

           I didn’t want to start this book. Many people are praising it but I’m simply not into erotica, it’s too cheap for me. But here I am in the mind of the innocent waiting to be devoured by the big bad wolf. Sounds pornographic, doesn’t it? That’s because it is… Christian Grey. A hot dude that melts a woman’s panties off with just one look. The perfect sex toy set out to conquer an innocent girl. Grey (the sick f*ck) is considered one of the hottest characters out there but he doesn’t get to me. His dominance is too much for me to handle and his attitude tends to be annoying and slimy. Plus he’s just wrong in the head so there’s no need to add more about this creep. Anastasia is an immature insecure desperate idiot who wants to become the whore of Babylon. She just wants to listen to her inner goddess (wtf?!) and have creepy monkey sex with Grey. She has no personality nor will whatsoever, she gets excited over the smallest and most idiotic things you can imagine and even though she sees how wrong Grey (the sick f*ck) is, she still goes for it. She’s always mooning over Grey like he’s some kind of god that she’s supposed to worship. He tells her that he doesn’t want a serious relationship just sex and she’s still ok with it. Why? Just because he’s hot? He’s a damn disgusting pervert. He hurt her the first time they made love, she was a virgin for Christ’s sake (and I don’t buy the crap with it being perfect, surely she had vaginal cracks after that), and is treating her like a slave. Even though he’s a successful businessman and he’s rich and famous he still can be a psychopath. Just watch American Psycho and you’ll know what I’m talking about.Now to pick on one of my biggest problems regarding this book: THE CONTRACT. WTF may I ask? Signing paperwork in order to have sex with him? Is he a natural hazard or what? I get the whole Hey look at me I’m badass, I have my own company and helicopter gig ‘cause the guy is stinking rich but the contract??? Isn’t anyone getting angry with this? I guess not...
   “Why would I do that?”“To please me”
Wtf?? All women want to please him? Why? ‘Cause he’s hot? He’s a perverted assh*le that’s what he is. He’s acting like he owns everyone! Aren’t you guys angry? 
  “I have rules, and I want you to comply with them. They are for your benefit and for my pleasure. If you follow these rules to my satisfaction, I shall reward you. If you don’t, I shall punish you, and you will learn,”
Learn this! *kicks him in the groin* Creep!
  “It’s about gaining your trust and your respect, so you’ll let me exert my will over you.”
Heh *right eye twitches* exert my will *eye twitches again*Aren’t you guys angry with this yet??  …Question for all the people who gave this book great scores. If Grey wasn’t so hot would you still have given it such great ratings? I doubt you would. So this means that the reason why you love the book is mainly Christian Grey being hot and an uber alpha? Shallow much? Or maybe you’re into all the Christian Grey induced monkey sex and torture. Psycho much? But who am I to judge.This book is just a desperate woman’s sick fantasy to be treated like a sex slave. I’m sorry but it doesn’t work for me. I DNF’d this because I find it disgusting and degrading. P.S. (I have to mention this because some people are too smart to get it) MY REVIEW IS STRICTLY RELATED TO FIFTY SHADES OF GREY AND NOT BDSM IN GENERAL. So take a chill pill and GTFO.
         
        
      YAY! Start this as soon as you finish SJ #3, k??

      I LOVE the review, Anzu! It might just be my favorite of all your reviews I&apos;ve read so far! And now I&apos;m even more reluctant about reading this book again. I should probably just read a few more chapters out of principle and screw the rest...

      Since I&apos;m not planning on reading the book, it can&apos;t influence me=))
    
  
        
      Cool :D if you do read it remember: it is supposed to be erotica, BDSM erotica actually.
    
  
        
      Thank you Madu :D it&apos;s sick to the bone!
    
  
        
      Dude you have no IDEA what she read in her time :))
    
  
        
      =)))))))I can&apos;t read erotica anymore.....They bore me to death :))) It&apos;s the same thing in every single book
    
  
        
      See, but this isn&apos;t the usual erotica ;;)
    
  
        
      Not interested =)))
    
  
        
      Good girl, Madu! And Aly, check the Q&amp;A thread. :D
    
  
        
      YOU ARE SO NOT FUN! :D Really love, why do you do this to me? :DDee I know the Q but I have no idea how to formulate my answer :D and what Q to ask :))
    
  
        
      @Madu: I&apos;ve also read some erotica and they were so damn cheesy and boring that I gave up the genre entirely. This being said, I feel you! And you really should avoid this book :D Aly is just in need or something that&apos;s why she loved it so much :p@Aly: Stop being lazy and answer/ask the damn question!
    
  
        
      Anzu, respect. I bow to your review.

      You&apos;ve expressed the book perfectly, Anzu. I have no idea why the hell there are such high ratings.

      Wow, wow, wow, what a review! Great, Anzu! I totally agree with you! Although I think they didn&apos;t make love when she lost her virginity. Grey just f***ed her. And no, I don&apos;t think that Grey is hot and an uber alpha either. *shudders*

Im not a perv or desperate or any of the ridiculous things you&apos;ve mentioned! Im just saying. I think to attack and ridicule one for their taste in books is disrespectful and for you guys to like this drivel are insane...thats my opinion:)

For those of you who have not read the book, well, you’ll have to buy a copy to understand the inside joke. CONTRACTDated this day 28th day of October, 2011 BETWEENP.A. LUPTON (reader, and fan, Fifty Shades of Grey by E L James)AndALL FANS OF EROTIC, CONTEMPORARY ROMANCEEXPECTATIONSReaders can expect to find within the pages of this book a flawless rendering of the internal, psychological struggles of a novice submissive in a BDSM relationship. Anastasia Steele is an innocent to sexual relationships, let alone BDSM relationships. E L James captures perfectly her fears, confusions, insecurities, and internal conflicts as she deals with falling in first love with a man who epitomizes the meaning of dominant.CHARACTERSThe reader shall discover within this novel two of the most well thought out and in depth characters. The hero Christian Grey admits that he is “Fifty shades of Fu*#&amp;ed up,” which makes the reader want to delve in and learn about each of those fifty shades. The heroine Anastasia Steele is a study in contradictions: smart but naïve, innocent yet sensual, independent yet submissive, and these paradoxes keep the reader captivated and eager to learn more. THE PARTIES AGREE AS FOLLOWSUpon signing this contract, you (the fan) agree to proceed to your nearest bookstore, or e-book retailer, and immediately purchase a copy of Fifty Shades of Grey.

Your signature on this contract further indicates your accord in following the rules set out in APPENDIX 1 to this agreement.SIGNATURE______________________						APPENDIX 1RULES1.	Please ensure that you have Kleenex prepared when you read this novel as build up of emotions will unavoidably lead to the inadvertent shedding of tears.2.	Make certain to schedule ample time for reading as once you begin you will be unable to put your book down. Be warned: If obligations force you to cease reading prior to completion, for long periods of time, it will inevitably lead to impatience and frustration.3.	IMPORTANT: Cold liquids, ice, cool cloths, or any cooling equipment such as central air or electric fans should be close at hand. Reading the romantic (i.e. sex) scenes in this book without these cooling devices will certainly lead to overheating. 4.	Enjoy!

      I don&apos;t know if I like eroticas but I will give it a go. It does seem intriguing. I try to be open minded, but I need plot to go with sex. Gratuitous sex doesn&apos;t work for me in books
    
  
        
      LOL, loved the review and of course it is my type of book - hee hee, thanks for the recommendation and I will take it in advisement to have something cold to drink to keep me cooled off so I wont over heat, then again I could just go attack hubby - LMAO!
    
  
        
      This book is out of my comfort zone, but i&apos;m certainly very intrigued, so it goes on my wishlist ;)
    
  
        
      Thanks for the rec&apos;. I see quite a few of my friends have approved this book too!

      I started the fan fic version, it was a bit out of my comfort zone, I couldn&apos;t finish it. But I am so excited she got it published.

      P.A., thanks so much for recommending this book. Like many others who commented here, it is a little out of my comfort zone, but I took a chance because I was intrigued, and WOW! I loved it! Not just because of the steamy scenes (which still have me fanning myself!) but because of the touches of humor throughout. The Emails Ana and Christian kept exchanging had me giggling, as did their playful banter. Anyway, thanks! I&apos;ll be devouring book 2 as soon as I&apos;ve finished absorbing this one!

      P.A.,For selfish reasons, I took you up on your recommendation of this book. I hadn&apos;t read erotica fiction before and I wanted to compare a sex scene I&apos;d written in my own novel, Not To Us, to make sure I was within bounds and got it right. Seriously, I worry about this stuff. Whatever. I was curious how an author &quot;in the genre&quot; pulled it off.So. The story hooked me right away. I live in Seattle; imagine my happy count to discover it was based in my town. Awesome!The story is amazing, intriguing, intense, dark, and connects well emotionally. (I know. You thought I was describing Christian Grey, for a moment, until that last part). Finished last night and I&apos;m still thinking about it! This morning I was relieved to find Shades of Darker is already out. THANK GOD. I wasn&apos;t going to be able to wait for long before finding out what happens to these two.Geez, I have my own third novel to write and I wasn&apos;t able to put this one down. I love Kindle for a lot of reasons, but being able to read this novel anytime, anywhere was particular helpful. : )Katherine OwenAuthor

      I read the fanfic version, I loved it. Fanfic to published though, my brain gets all jammed up between the fanfic characters and the published characters. But I am thrilled the story was published and wish the author all the deserved success she is getting.

I would never have known.
    
  
        
      The writer did a fantastic job with changing the characteristics and genre of the story. She is definitely talented in the ability to do that alone. But I find once you read a great fanfic and then its published, even with the changes making it an original, my brain doesn&apos;t let go of the fanfic characters and actually will replace as I read. It&apos;s defintely my problem trying to go from fanfic to original version. But I know people are loving it and that is great. It really is a good story.
    
  
        
      If what I remember is right, Bella and Ana are both brunettes, and Edward and Christian both have reddish/bronze-colored hair. That&apos;s where any similarities end. Ana and Christian are SO much more interesting! (And E.L. James is are far better writer)

I still like my vampire stories though but it&apos;s nice for a change. What I don&apos;t get is why, if Christian is supposed to be Edward is he not a vampire. Not only that, Edward is a virgin. Totally different characters.
    
  
        
      There are a great many fanfic original stories that use Twilight characters and names. They are definetly not Twilight stories. 50 Shades (MOTU) was an original story. The basic personaity traits of the Twilight characters were there as well as the broad storyline, but thats it.

      OMG yes! You are a girl after my own heart. Edward&apos;s POV is so much more interesting. And I agree, unfinished, abandoned stories from FF authors or published authors are the absolute most frustrating thing ever!
    
  
        
      I like his POV because you can see inside of everyone&apos;s head so it&apos;s almost like third person POV but better.
    
  
        
      Totally agree. From what was posted, I loved it and hope all the time SM will actually finish it one day. It really did make for such an interesting version.
    
  
        
      Speaking of Midnight Sun, I wonder if E.L. James has ever considered rewriting Fifty Shades from Christian&apos;s point of view? I think it would be an eye-opener-and-a-half...

           I don&apos;t often give books five stars and as I neared the end of this book, I gave some thought to how many stars this book deserved. I&apos;ve read the Anne of Green Gables series once before - over twenty years ago. In spite of the amount of time that has elapsed, I clearly recall reading the last book in the series very slowly and thinking to myself, &quot;I will be so sad to not be able to read about Anne anymore.&quot; When I picked up this book a few days ago to re-read it, I found within a few chapters that it was like seeing an old friend. Anne was even more delightful than I recalled, since I now have daughters who share her &quot;scope for imagination,&quot; her penchant for large words and her zest for life. Reading about Anne&apos;s appreciation for life&apos;s loveliness made me appreciate my daughters and long to live more in-the-moment myself. So, I decided that a book that feels like an old friend after twenty years deserves five stars.Anne Shirley must be one of the most delightful characters ever written, largely because she is far from perfect. She makes mistakes, as we all do, but her mistakes are much funnier than my own feel and she makes me see the value in learning from each of them, laughing at them and moving on. Like my middle daughter, there is no lukewarm with Anne. I love that she approaches life enthusiastically, despite have spent a decade belonging to no one.I also like that Anne talks straightforwardly about wanting, seeking and building friendships. Even now, I am hesitant, awkward and scattershot at building relationships. I may meet someone who seems a kindred spirit, but lack the time or, let&apos;s be honest, sheer boldness to approach them and seek to build a friendship. We see Anne seek and build relationships not only upon her arrival in Avonlea, but during her time at Queens.One reasons I re-read this book was because two friends recommended it for it&apos;s fluency in writing dialogue. Unlike Little Women, which I attempted to read for the writing, this book did not disappoint. The dialogue sounds exactly like each character would sound and it flows smoothly from narration to dialogue and back. In fact, I&apos;m baffled that Little Women routinely makes top 100 lists while Anne of Green Gables is nowhere to be found on the lists of must-read classics. Unlike the Little Women characters who are archetypes rather than three dimensional characters, Anne is a bold a female character who refuses to be categorized. That&apos;s exactly why I love her and love this book.
         
        
      Have you read this before? It&apos;s been my favorite book and movie for as long as I can remember. She&apos;s such an amazing character. I wish I had her enthusiastic and positive outlook on life. I love the effect she has on the people around her- she influences everyone she comes in contact with. I love it.
    
  
        
      I was talking a little at girls night about how I don&apos;t re-read books very often. (I can only come up with about 10 books I&apos;ve ever re-read.) So, I have read this book - once - in middle school. I read the entire series and clearly remember thinking when I got to the last book, &quot;I&apos;ll be so sad to not be able to read about Anne anymore.&quot; So I remember how the books made me feel, but not much about the content. Mikkee Hall loves these books and re-reads them every year. She suggested I read it for a good example of meshing story with dialogue, so your review prompted me to put it on my to read list.
    
  
        
      This is one of the few series of books I reread constantly also. I think you will really enjoy them and am looking forward to your review!
    
  
        
      I am so glad you liked it when you re-read! I also think Anne is one of the best characters around. When we moved to Nashville when I was 7, I had a forest green bedroom and nicknamed it &quot;Green Gables,&quot; I was so in love with those books (and still am). And (forgive my soap box) I think Anne is a MUCH better role model for young girls than Bella in Twilight, because even though she doesn&apos;t recognize true love in Gilbert right away, she does eventually realize the difference between her &quot;imaginary&quot; version of love and the reality. As a girl, I always thought back to Anne&apos;s mistake when I would get a bit too carried away with my schoolgirl crushes. I hope you re-read the rest of the series and enjoy them just as much!

There are just too many books out there begging to be read. I started The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Society last night. I requested it several months ago from the library and have been waiting to work my way up the queue.
    
  
        
      I know what you mean about the library queue, you definitely have to read them when you get them! I love the title of that book, I look forward to your review.
    
  
        
      Great review! I regret that I never read them as a girl. (They &quot;sounded weird&quot; and I never liked things about the country, like Little House on the Prairie...) I might just have to pick it up now to see what I&apos;ve been missing. Oh, and I totally appreciate your comment about making friendships!
    
  
        
      I&apos;m glad this book got 5 stars from Shannon. That&apos;s quite an honor! It totally deserves it, though. She truly is one of the most delightful characters ever written. I&apos;m re-reading Book 4 now, and hoping to make it through all of them this year. She really does feel like an old friend.
    
  
        
      These books are one of my favourite too! At school, when I was 15 I won a prize in an Edinburgh-wide essay competition and used the book token I got to buy most of the series. If they weren&apos;t hard back books I&apos;m sure they would be showing the multiple readings more! They are such great insights into a diverse set of characters - and I&apos;m continually challenged, like you mentioned, to live more in the moment - to allow an enthusiasm for life &amp; other people to show!And on that note, I really do miss seeing your girls in the office here!
    
  
        
      This discussion has inspired me to read this series! I only ever read the first book as a child and thought it was just okay. I think as a girl I didn&apos;t want to read these because I was resentful of the way teachers, my mother, etc kept trying to make me read &quot;girly&quot; authors likes Montgomery and Alcott, but now that I am an adult I will try to give them a fair shake.
    
  
      I totally agree with you Shannon, Little Women is really hard to read; but my main point is that I totally agree with you on the great storybooks about Anne. She&apos;s like a sister.
    
  
        
      Thanks for your wonderful review. I have not read this since childhood but it&apos;s my favourite from childood, and after reading your review I want to read it again. I have as an adult seen the wonderful TV mini-series produced of it: the character chosen for Anne was just as I had imagined her, uncannily so!
    
  
        
      I love Anne to. would in it be grear to have an imagination like Anne.  from, Sophia age8
    
  
        
      Shannon, your review of this amazing book was awesome. I first read this when I was in grade ten. Anne (that&apos;s with an &apos;e&apos;) was and still is my favourite female characters of all time. Like you said she approaches life enthusiastically, without no one really cares for her until she came to Green Gables in the care of Marilla ( a strong willed woman, but loved Anne all the same) and her soft hearted brother Matthew who adored Anne. I now have a teen-age daughter and this is one of her favourite book as well. Anne, was a brave and strong-willed young girl with a great imaginations that a lot of young girls today lacked. Thanks again for your great review.
    
  
        
      I am finding so many different editions of this book in flipkart and amazon not able to decide which one is the original work and which one should I buy. Can you help me?
    
  
        
      Bindu, this one looks like a good place to start and it&apos;s available via paperback or kindle: http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/1500426...
    
  
        
      Thank you Shannon. Is it un-abridged version?
    
  
        
      Yes, it&apos;s unabridged.

      I read Anne of Green Gables for the first time just a few months ago and your review captures my thoughts so well! I too have daughters and I saw them as well as myself in Anne and the other characters. I too compared it to my experience reading Little Women and Little Women felt like hard work while Anne enveloped me until I was no longer reading the story, but living it. I can&apos;t believe that Anne doesn&apos;t get more praise and distinction. If she did I&apos;m sure I would have read her much sooner. I can at least make sure my daughters won&apos;t miss out.
    
  
        
      I like your review of this book. I&apos;m currently reading Anne of Green Gables and I&apos;m loving it. I am actually very upset with myself for waiting so long to read this book because the movies have always been my all time favorites. I decided to read it for a reading challenge I&apos;m doing and I&apos;m very glad I finally decided to read it.
    
  
        
      anne of green gables is a definite masterpiece, i read it many years ago but i keep re-reading it. the story is touching and characters are lovely. every one should read the book and enjoy Montgomery&apos;s magic...
    
  
        
      I think I have read this book and the entire series (except the last book) at least twenty times since the 1980s (when I first discovered it). Most of the books are like old friends and comforting to read and reread (except for Rilla, where I as a person of German origin just cannot get over how vicious Susan Baker&apos;s anti German sentiment, her ultra-nationalism is not only hard to stomach but kind of frightening).I loved your review, and if I had not already read Anne&apos;s story, it would definitely have made me add it to my to-read list. Have you read the Emily series?
    
  
        
      I have only made it two books through this series but i really enjoy them
    
  
        
      This is by far the best book I have read this year. Great story and good characters make this book more heart warming.

      Great review! I am reading book 4 at the moment after binge reading the first three almost 5-6 months back and it does feel like meeting an old friend again after a long time. I am thinking about re-reading the first 3 books again before I continue with the series mainly to catch up on all the characters introduced.
    
  
        
      I love all of LM Montgomery&apos;s books and all the characters feel like friends. I have all of her books and even did a paper on her in high school. I hate how some of the newer books changed the english of the time. The one Canadian I have always loved the most.🇨🇦
    
  
        
      Great review, Shannon! What doesn’t stop to amaze me is how simple and good this book is. And by good I mean ethically as well as a fine story.
    
  
        
      Wow! Excellent review, Shannon.
    
  
        
      I dont Prime
    
  
        
      My mom loved this series and tried to get me to read it but at 10 I didn&apos;t want to read books about a girl. But since we are visiting Prince Edward Island this year I thought I would give it another try at 53. I found it quite delightful.
    
  
        
      They have a Netflix series after this book it was great and I really want to read the book
    
  
        
      The book is a quick read and both the wife and I finished it quickly. We went to Prince Edward Island and it was great to see the house in person. Amazing to see how much worldwide tourism comes to this small island because of the author&apos;s books. They even host a running play based on Anne&apos;s romance.

           &quot;Dear old world,&quot; she murmured, &quot;you are very lovely and I am glad to be alive in you.&quot;This quote really accurately depicts how Anne lives her life and what makes you love her as a character. She&apos;s stubborn and makes mistakes, but she also has a huge imagination and sees the world as beautiful and full of possibilities.I loved this SO much and I&apos;m sad I never read it before! I love all the characters and the plot, and it&apos;s really fun to see Anne grow up through this book. The writing is also really really lovely.I can&apos;t wait to read the sequels and follow Anne&apos;s story! This has made it up to my favorite books of all time list, that&apos;s for sure.REREAD NOTESI didn&apos;t think I could love this book more but somehow I do?? I AM SO EMOTIONAL.
         
        
      I just recently read this for the first time, too! I finished the audio book for Anne of Avonlea yesterday. So lovely.
    
  
        
      Gotta watch the movie! So good, the actors they picked were perfect, especially Anne and Gilbert!

      I loved the live show!
    
  
        
      My favorite series of all time..
    
  
        
      Great quote! Truly sums up Anne in few words. She doesn&apos;t take any aspect of life for granted.
    
  
        
      i totally agree with you
    
  
        
      Great quote capture. I’m glad to be alive IN you.
    
  
        
      Did you read the rest of the book series?

           How do you review a book that transcends books?Do you ever love a book so much that it doesn’t feel like a book? You’re so immersed and reading is so effortless that you don’t feel like you’re reading at all? The characters are real enough to be people, and their problems and happinesses feel like they’re happening to you?That was me with this book.Which is all well and good until it comes down to reviewing it. Basically what I’m saying is I’m at a loss for words. I’m saying I have nothing TO say. This is just too damn good.I didn’t read this as a kid, or for many years after. I didn’t think I’d be interested. I had a copy for years with no intention of picking it up, because I am shallow as hell and only bought a copy in the first place because it’s pretty. (In my defense: look HOW pretty.) Honestly, I can’t remember why I decided to read it in the first place.But I am very, very, VERY glad I did.I love Anne so much. I love Green Gables. I love Diana, I love Matthew and Marilla, later on I love Gilbert (although I don’t really understand how people love him from this book alone. Not much to see). After reading this, I was obligated to chase the high of the reading experience by picking up the next two installments as quickly as possible, and they were just as good. Mostly. But still an unparalleled level of good.I guess what I’m trying to carry across here is that somehow this hundred year old children’s classic about an orphan girl moving to a rural island in Canada was one of the most unputdownable books I’ve ever read.And also the writing is as pretty as the cover.Bottom line: I want to live in this book, please and thank you.-----------fun fact: joy exists as a concrete object, and it&apos;s called Anne of Green Gables.THIS BOOK IS PURE JOY.review to come
         
        
      YOU&apos;RE READING MY CHILDHOOD. Anne is my heart, my constant friend, and the book that understand me best.

           4.5 starsAnne, my lovely, I feel restored. 
&quot;Marilla!&quot; Anne sat down on Marilla&apos;s gingham lap, took Marilla&apos;s lined face between her hands, and looked gravely and tenderly into Marilla&apos;s eyes. &quot;I&apos;m not a bit changed—not really. I&apos;m only just pruned down and branched out. The real me—back here—is just the same. It won&apos;t make a bit of difference where I go or how much I change outwardly; at heart I shall always be your little Anne, who will love you and Matthew and dear Green Gables more and better every day of her life.&quot;
Full RTC.Pre-review:You know what? I&apos;ve been wanting to reread these books for probably a decade, and I&apos;m still (inexplicably) battling my ever present book funk, so I&apos;m just gonna do it. Gilbert Blythe, you were my first and best book boyfriend. See you soon ;)

Mich, these are the best books EVER. My grandmother got them for me sometime between 2nd and 4th grade, and I was instantly smitten. A few years after that, she got me the miniseries, which are surprisingly accurate. If you can&apos;t squeeze the books in, you MUST at least watch them. *flails*

It has all but two of the Anne books (they were published after the date that&apos;s covered under whatever it is that makes classics available for free), but you can get both of them of $0.99 each. &gt;:D

      Hey guys! I&apos;m new here. Who can help me to fine the complete series of Anne?! I&apos;m Iranian and in my country there&apos;s only translated one! I need it in English. Is there any website where I can register and read some english books online?! Because here we can&apos;t pay and buy books and ebooks from some where like kindle, Amazon and so on!

      I got this book Christmas of 2016 and did not get around to reading it until the late summer of 2017.SPOILER:I like how you can tell Gilbert Blithe LIKES Anne Shirley. So cute! Gilbert is definitely one of three or four of my: &apos;Fictional characters you would go out on a date with&apos;.This book is amazing! Read it!
    
  
        
      I loved this book I thought it only needed 1 star but at the end I thought it needed 5 stars
    
  
        
      GILBERT!!! Be still my beating heart.. SPOILERI was so happy when they got married that I cried. It was beautiful!

           I&apos;m so glad I&apos;ve finally read this book! I started reading it as a young girl, and got distracted by the 10 other books I was reading at the time and never finished it...Anyhow, it was such a fun read, and I&apos;m sure I&apos;ll read it again someday!
         
        
      Omg I just started the audio book because growing up I hated reading, but have heard great things about this series. I&apos;m loving it! can&apos;t wait to see Anne grow up.
    
  
        
      Anne of Green Gables continues to be one of my favorite novels. I now own the box set of the whole series and loved seeing Anne go through her life. It&apos;s so awesome hearing other people who enjoyed the book!
    
  
        
      Its the Best book i have ever read

           I never read Anne&apos;s story when I was younger, so when I heard that Rachel McAdams was narrating the first in the series I knew I had to give it a go. I&apos;m a sucker for a celebrity-narrated audiobook (if you haven&apos;t checked out Maggie Gyllenhaal&apos;s reading of  The Bell Jar, do that now!).It&apos;s wonderful to read a story that, for the most part, is extremely uplifting. There&apos;s hardly anything truly terrible that happens in this story, and that&apos;s quite refreshing. Granted, it is a children&apos;s novel and from the early 1900&apos;s—so it has that moralistic quality to it wherein each incident Anne undergoes resolves itself with a lesson learned. But it was delightful, and Anne&apos;s optimism is contagious. Rachel McAdams also does a great job at encapsulating that attitude; I felt like I could hear her smile.If, like me, you&apos;ve never given Anne&apos;s story a chance, I can highly recommend the audiobook route. And I&apos;m definitely going to continue listening to this series, especially when I&apos;m in need of a pick-me-up.
         
        
      I read this novel during summer and I enjoyed it so much. I am on the second book Anne of Avonlea.
    
  
        
      I am also a sucker for celebrity-narrated books :):) And this one was amazing! Totally agree with you!!!
    
  
        
      Oh! I have enjoyed it so much! English is a seconed language to me , it was easier to listen to the Audiobook, I was lucky that the narrator was Rachel McAdams, her voice was so engaging!
    
  
        
      I enjoyed this read so much! I questioned it at first being in children&apos;s literature, but came to love it. I&apos;m glad I listened to the many people who recommended it as a quality read.

           &quot;Excitement hung around Anne like a garment, shone in her eyes, kindled in every feature.&quot;Oh, what sheer pleasure it was to spend just a moment in time with Anne and her delightful companions in this little classic. What pure joy to catch a glimpse of the beauty of Prince Edward Island. I am likely one of the last persons on earth… well, on Goodreads at least… to read this novel. What in the world was I waiting for?! As a child and adolescent, I wrongly assumed that this book would be of no interest to me. I wasn’t a ‘girly girl’ and surely this was written for ‘that sort’ of reader, right? Wrong! By the time I was old enough to know better, I thought I had grown too mature in years to pick this one up. Wrong again. The ‘sort’ of reader that this does appeal to however: one who appreciates exquisite writing and vibrant characters, one who relishes being steeped in another time and place, and one who enjoys an all-out fantastic story. In short, this book should satisfy nearly everyone!You can’t help but fall in love with Anne. She is the friend you have always longed for, the daughter that will bring that much-needed light in your life, that student that any teacher would be proud to instruct. She is funny, imaginative, bright, and a regular chatterbox. She laments about her red hair, apologizes for being a ‘great trial’ to Marilla, and always manages to see the positive in most everything. However, she does maintain a long-standing rivalry with her peer, Gilbert Blythe. &quot;She was as intense in her hatreds as in her loves.&quot; Nothing is ever lukewarm when it comes to Anne’s feelings. There were moments I wanted to laugh with her and moments when I wanted to cry. When she first arrived at Green Gables, Anne learned that it had all been a mistake. For, Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert meant to adopt a young boy to help with the chores. A little girl was not needed. It nearly crushed me when Anne fell in love with Green Gables only to find that she must surely be turned away and carted straight back to the orphanage. &quot;Have you ever noticed what cheerful things brooks are? They’re always laughing… I shall always like to remember that there is a brook at Green Gables even if I never see it again.&quot; What transpires after this will melt even the most hardened hearts.Some might say this book is too wholesome, too charming, and perhaps too unrealistic. I have to say that I don’t believe those are good enough reasons to skip reading this enchanting novel! It didn’t take place just yesterday so I didn’t expect the trials and tribulations of today’s day and age. The events do occur on an idyllic island, so I felt the beautiful scenery I was immersed in was wholly believable. Anne is not a perfect little girl and each character has their share of flaws. Not every story has to be full of doom and gloom to get all the stars! Sometimes one just needs to sit back, relax, and just surrender to the small pleasures in life. We could all use a lesson from Anne’s book of optimism here and there!&quot;Dear old world, you are lovely, and I am glad to be alive in you.&quot;

      If you do get it, Candi, I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll love that book. If it hadn&apos;t been winter, I probably would have packed, got in my car and driven there - or to wherever you take to get to the island!
    
  
        
      Such a beautiful review, Candi.You made me smile just by reading it.It gave me a touch of Green Gables happy.And I agree wholeheartedly about all books not needing to be about gloom and doom and misery and pain to get the 5 stars.People are not always in gloom and doom mode either.Love Anne...her stubborness and her sweetness...
    
  
        
      Do read the whole series if you can Candi.
    
  
        
      I really want to read this! I started it when I was younger but never finished. Thanks for the review! Definitely going to read this soon!!!
    
  
        
      I&apos;m so glad you loved this, Candi. I can remember as a child wanting to BE Anne. I loved these books so much that I read them several times and the librarian gently suggested I should &quot;read something else&quot;. I was sort of sorry I revisited them as an adult. I had such a strong connection to them that it felt like something was missing--of course, what was missing was my own childhood self. I don&apos;t think anyone should miss out on this story. BTW, if you want to see a fabulous treatment of this book, watch the series that was done with Megan Follows. Superb.
    
  
        
      Charming review, Candi. Your review reawaken memories of this book. Lovely.
    
  
        
      Sara, if you&apos;re talking about the Netflix production, Anne With An E, I totally agree. Wonderful casting, and very true to the book.
    
  
        
      Lovely review, Candi! I would love to re-visit these books as it has been many decades since I read them. I was worried that my memories would result in disenchantment if I re-read - your review has disabused me of that notion so thank you! 😊
    
  
        
      Lovely review. This was my favourite book when I was younger. Who wouldn&apos;t want to have Anne as a bosom friend? I never did finish the series though, and I think I&apos;ll have to look into that.Like Sara, I was curious what I would think of it when reading it again as an adult, but thankfully it hadn&apos;t lost any of its magic for me. I found myself smiling along with all of Anne&apos;s adventures, and enjoyed just as much.

      Great review, Candi. This is one of my all time favorite reads and characters. What is not to love about Anne Shirley and Marilla and Matthew and Gilbert Blythe. You should read on in the series. I loved them all but none were quite as great as the first one that introduces us to this charming character. I first read it as a young teen and fell in love and have read through the entire series a couple of times and read the first one more than that. Also you need to watch the series starring Meghan Fellows from the 80s. She perfectly personified Anne.
    
  
        
      You transported me back to this totally charming and unforgettable book. Well done. I agree with you.

           The beloved classic 1908 novel about an orphan girl who mistakenly comes to the Prince Edward Island home of aging brother and sister Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert (they had wanted a boy to help Matthew with chores). After an initial kerfuffle about sending Anne back to the orphanage and getting the boy they had intended, hearts are softened, and Anne proceeds to upend their lives ... in what turns out to be very good ways for everyone involved. Anne is eleven years old when she first comes to Green Gables, and the novel follows her adventures over the next five years. It’s kind of an episodic novel, with memorable characters. Anne is a chatterbox with a tremendously vivid imagination, passionate and sincere. Marilla and Matthew are drawn so well that I feel like I really know them (though it&apos;s disconcerting to realize that Matthew in the book has a long beard. My mind&apos;s eye refuses to see him that way, LOL. The miniseries has co-opted my imagination). And then there&apos;s Gilbert, who lives to regret some initial teasing about Anne&apos;s hair.The novel has a healthy sense of humor that sets it apart from most literature of this period and keeps it from being too sticky sweet. It’s really so charming, with great insights into human nature, and lovely descriptions of P.E.I. It&apos;s a feel-good story and a total comfort read!Anne of Green Gables spawned a slew of sequels and five other related novels, not to mention any number of film and TV adaptations. Not all of the sequels are great reads like this one - they start getting progressively more sappy - but I do recommend the first four books in this series if you liked this one.
         
        
      I loved this series, too! And I so enjoy your reviews because you address quality literature of multiple genres that I enjoy. And we think alike; though, you have the gift of clearly and concisely conveying your thoughts so much more eloquently. Thanks, Tadiana!

           This story is cute, touching, heart-warming, tear-jerking. In other words, a classic!The target audience is definitely not me. I would say it would be perfect for a teenage girl living in Canada in the early 1900s. That makes sense, because that is exactly what Anne is! However, the point of this obvious detail is that sometimes it is fun to read a classic and try to put your mind in the mindset of who it was written for at the time. A couple of the storylines seemed silly or to not make sense, but if I stopped and changed my mindset, it would click.A bit of a history lesson combined with a well written story. If you haven&apos;t read this before, give it a shot and maybe you will find your inner early 1900s Canadian teenager!
         
        
      I liked a lot of the sequels better.
    
  
        
      not my cup of tea to read

      I enjoyed it. Anne&apos;s dialogue is clever and a bit zany. I thought she was a refreshing character as opposed to so many angst driven characters we read about today.
    
  
        
      I haven&apos;t read the books, but I have seen the movies a long time ago and I really liked them. Something to watch on the lighter side of life. :)
    
  
        
      If you were a young, bookish, imaginative girl who felt like she didn&apos;t fit in with her surroundings - this book was as great in 1980s Midwestern USA as it would have been in 1900s Canada!
    
  
        
      I am a male in my sixties, and I have spent my entire life avoiding this book -- until last year. I had a bias against it as a book intended for pre-teen girls, but, once I read it, I was delighted by Lucy Maude Montgomery&apos;s command of language, her deft turns of phrase, her vivid characters and descriptions, and her clever dialogue.This book may not speak to everyone, but, primarily because of Montgomery&apos;s quality of writing, I rated it 5 stars...and wondered what took me so long to read it.
    
  
        
      Great review, eh... ;)

Yes, true! I don&apos;t remember a lot of girls around me reading this back when I was in middle school, but they probably were (especially since it was in the midwest during the time frame you mentioned! )

You may find a lot of greatness you have been missing. This is why I have been doing my best to give everything a shot.

      Great point about the history lesson. The life Anne had before Green Gables would have broken so many but she persevered and grew. Going to be visiting the home next month, can&apos;t wait.

      One of my all time favourites!! I was a teenage girl in Canada and I can tell you, it definitely made my top ten list!
